<h2>I.</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE SWORD OF DAMOCLES.</h3>
</div>
<p>We built our cabin high on the slopes of
the Sangre de Christo range, overlooking
the broad, level San Luis Valley, in Colorado.
At the rear of the cabin rose a towering
cliff or rather a huge slab of rock
standing edgewise more than two hundred
feet high, apparently the upheaval of some
mighty convulsion of nature in ages gone.
Near the base of this cliff flowed a clear
crystal spring.</p>
<p>Some hundred yards west of the cabin
was the mouth of a tunnel into which we
had drifted with pick, shovel and giant
powder, a distance of 300 feet in five
months of hard toil. A trail led from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
tunnel to the cabin along the mountain side,
which was thickly studded with tall pines.
Another trail led down the mountain slopes
in a winding way to the valley, almost a
mile below. Above, reaching far into the
blue dome of the sky, rose the peaks of the
snow-capped Sangre de Christo, glistening
in the morning sunlight, which threw
gaunt, fantastic shadows in ca&ntilde;on and deep
ravine.</p>
<p>It was a wild, weird scene, where man,
in strength and vigor, seems to imbibe a
portion of the divine essence that lives, and
moves, and has its being in the vast solitudes.</p>
<p>We struck pay rock at the first thirty
feet of tunneling, so Amos&rsquo; assay showed,
and the rock had gradually increased in
value, week by week. Buchan would take
samples of the ore every week or ten days
and walk a distance of twenty-five miles
to Saguache, where old man Amos, expert
geologist and assayer, would for two dollars
and fifty cents make out a clean printed
slip with figures in red ink, showing so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
many ounces of lead, copper, silver and
gold to the ton.</p>
<p>The ore had not yet reached a value
which would pay to ship it, but the increase
of values was so steady, and Amos was so
extravagantly encouraging, that we were
always in buoyant expectation of rich ore.
He would say, &ldquo;You boys have a wonderful
prospect. Keep right on with your
work; it is getting richer with every stroke
of your pick and you are likely to uncover
a million dollar drift any day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buchan would bring the assay certificate
back to the cabin, where we would sit
late by the light of the pine knots in the
fire place and talk of the golden millions
which capitalists would yet gladly pay for
a half interest in the &ldquo;Aberdeen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the name Buchan had given
the mine, after his home town in Scotland,
of which he always spoke with a fond tenderness.</p>
<p>Winter had come and we, John Buchan,
Will Carson, and myself, had chipped in
almost our last dollar and brought a wagon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
load of flour, bacon and canned goods from
Saguache to the foot of the mountains, then
carried them on our backs to the cabin.
We quit work on the mine for ten days
and chopped firewood, which we corded at
the rear of our house. All hands felt that
we were as snugly housed for the winter
as the big grizzly bears in their lairs among
the rocks.</p>
<p>Snow had been falling for several days
and it lay deep on the mountain slopes and
in the wide expanse of the valley below.
We had not had an assay for two weeks
and all were anxious for another report
from Amos. Buchan wanted his mail also,
and he took a small bag of the rock and
tramped the twenty-five miles to Saguache.
It was a three days&rsquo; trip wading through
the unbroken snow drifts, and it was night
when he returned, weary, footsore and
angry.</p>
<p>I can see him yet, tears trickling down
his honest face, as he tried to tell something
about Amos. He spoke of &ldquo;the
scamp, the villain, and robber,&rdquo; and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
choked with rage. Like all Scotchmen, the
more he thought of the wrong done him,
the angrier he became; he would be more
angry tomorrow and it would be the day
after that his anger would reach the climax,
and begin to subside. This was not a
peculiarity of Buchan. It is a characteristic
of the Scotch.</p>
<p>We made him a cup of coffee and seated
him comfortably before the fire. When he
calmed down somewhat, he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing I did the next morning
after reaching Saguache, was to eat breakfast,
and then I took the samples of ore to
Amos&rsquo; assay office. He was garrulous as
usual, and said to come in two hours and
he would have the certificate of the assay
ready for me. When I again called he
handed me the certificate and I paid him
the usual two dollars and fifty cents. It
showed nine dollars and ninety cents to the
ton. The usual increase of ten per cent.
over the last assay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I crossed over to the postoffice, and
while waiting for my mail, I noticed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
snow standing ten inches high on the cap
of the flue of Amos&rsquo; assay furnace. I
thought, how in the deuce did he assay our
ore without melting the snow on the cap
of the flue? The more I thought about it
the more I was mystified. I went across
to his office and said, &lsquo;Amos, I suppose
you gave us the usual fire test on this ore?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yep,&rsquo; he answered. &lsquo;Then tell me,&rsquo; I cried,
&lsquo;how in the devil did you make the fire test
without melting the snow off the cap of
your furnace flue?&rsquo; &lsquo;Too cold to melt,&rsquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I rushed past him into the back
room. The furnace was cold and the frost
had gathered on the iron door. I don&rsquo;t
suppose there had been a fire in it for a
week. I took Amos by the whiskers and
told him to own up that he had not made a
fire test of our ore. Then he acknowledged
that he had been guessing at it all
along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean there is a doubt about
us having pay rock?&rdquo; we yelled in a chorus.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All kinds of doubt,&rdquo; said Buchan. &ldquo;I
am told there is a suspicion that Amos
gives everybody an assay showing values,
where there are no values&ndash;&ndash;this for the
purpose of keeping up work in the district&ndash;&ndash;and
to those who have found values, he
gives them an assay showing nothing. At
the same time he gives Rayder, the Denver
capitalist, a tip and he buys up the property
for a song, giving Amos a fat commission
for his part in the deal. The
chances are that we have no more gold in
our rock than there is in that jug handle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news was astounding. We sat for a
while by the fire like men stricken dumb.
There was no doubting Buchan&rsquo;s statement.
Deception was no part of his nature.
He was nearly twenty-six years of
age, athletic, strong and quick of perception.
He had seen much of the world and
knew men. No, there could be no doubt;
he was not mistaken.</p>
<p>We were heartsick. Almost our last dollar
had gone to pay for the bogus assay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
Our golden dream of months was vanishing.
Carson broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to Saguache tomorrow. I
shall pulverize that jug handle and take it
to Amos; he does not know me; I shall
have him assay it, and if he gives me gold
values there will be trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was awakened the next morning by the
sound of a hammer. Carson was pulverizing
the jug handle. After a hasty breakfast,
he buckled on his cartridge belt with
a Colt 44-six shooter in his holster, and
was soon wading through the snow-drifts
down the trail towards Saguache. I
watched him through the window until he
was lost to view.</p>
<p>The sun rose in a clear sky; the glistening
peaks of the Sangre de Christo shone
white against a turquoise blue; clumps of
snow melted from the branches of the pines
and made hollows in the smooth banks of
white where they fell.</p>
<p>I turned to Buchan. He was tossing
restlessly in his bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would hate to be Amos if he gives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
Carson an assay of values from that jug
handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he muttered incoherently.
&ldquo;The day of reckoning comes to all. I
have seen it. I have seen the sky turn
black, the waves rise mountain-high out of
the sea, the earth rock and reel, the dead
roll out of their coffins in the cerements
of their graves, the living fall upon their
faces to hide from the wrath of Almighty
God! I have seen it just as Paul tells
about it. I have heard the roar of the
winds, seen palaces crumble and fall&ndash;&ndash;like
John of Patmos, I lift up my voice&ndash;&ndash;I,
John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was at his side in a moment, and saw
that he was delirious. The exertion
through the snow the day before, the loss
of sleep and intense anger, had made him
ill. I knew of a few simple remedies at
hand, and in a little while I had him sleeping
soundly.</p>
<p>The sun became warmer as the day advanced.
The snow melted on the cabin
roof and froze in drooping icicles at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
eaves. All day I went noiselessly about
the cabin, letting Buchan sleep. A premonition
of impending danger crept over me.
I tried to throw off the dread feeling by
reading, but I could not concentrate my
thoughts on the pages of the book. Strange
thoughts came like they did to the man who
was being taken to the guillotine and
begged time of his captors to put his
thoughts on paper. I thought I would
write mine that day, or remember them at
least, but I cannot recall them. I only
know they were strange and fascinating,
as if I was living another life, on another
planet.</p>
<p>I brought in wood and water for the
night. The sound of the door slamming
awoke Buchan. He arose and sat by the
fire, which blazed up brightly from its
fresh supply of pine logs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, I see,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;but heavens
you were locoed this morning! talking
about the resurrection, the quaking earth,
and the dead rolling out from their
graves!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;All true,&rdquo; he said, quietly. &ldquo;I have
seen those things, and what has happened
once may happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was standing by the window, looking
out over the snow covered San Luis valley,
when even as he spoke I felt the ground
tremble. There was a rush of air and the
cabin became filled with a fine snow that
was stifling, then a thunderous roar, and
all was utter darkness.</p>
<p>I was choking with the snow particles. I
groped to the door and opened it and felt
a solid bank of snow.</p>
<p>I realized then that we were buried beneath
a snow slide.</p>
<p>We worked for hours, in silence and
darkness, digging our way through the
snow and shoveling it back into the cabin
as we tunneled toward the cliff. It was
early morning when we saw the light of
day.</p>
<p>Once in the open where we could breathe
the pure air we beheld a sight that would
appall the strongest heart. The great flat
rock, that had stood on edge at the back of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the cabin, was now slanting at a sharp angle
above our heads. The avalanche from
near the summit of the Sangre de Christo
had struck the cliff and with its incalculable
tons tilted it, piling itself hundreds of
feet in the depth about us. The cliff might
fall at any moment and blot us out of existence.</p>
<p>Reaching a point of sight near the open
space at the edge of the base of the cliff we
could see something of the awful havoc
wrought by the avalanche. Huge rocks had
been loosened from their foundations and
with the speed of a meteor dashed to the
valley below. Great pines one hundred
feet in height had been torn up by their
roots and hurled down the mountain side
by the tremendous weight of the avalanche.</p>
<p>The cliff had sheltered our cabin and
saved our lives.</p>
<p>We cleared the snow away from the
chimney and out of the cabin. Our wood
was dry and we soon had a cheerful fire
blazing and the tea kettle boiling. But living
under that slanting cliff, from which we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
could not escape, we felt, indeed that the
sword of Damocles hung by a spider web
above our heads.</p>
<p>When we had rested some and refreshed
ourselves with coffee, we tunneled from
the open space under the cliff to near the
entrance of the mine, intending to live in
the tunnel until the melting snows of the
spring released us from our prison. But
when we had tunneled through the snow to
near the entrance of the mine, we found
our way blocked by a debris of rock and
trees which would require weeks of labor
to remove. Tunnels in other directions
gave us no better results, and we became
resigned to our fate, returning to the cabin
to while away the dreary hours until the
hanging cliff above should become our
grave stone.</p>
<p>Days of gloom and monotony came and
went. We dug the snow away from our
windows and tunneled a hole to the top
which gave us a glare of reflected light.</p>
<p>Buchan had hitherto been silent as to his
past life. By a few stray remarks we had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
caught glimpses of his romantic career,
but now he began relating in detail incidents
of his early life in Scotland, or on the
high seas, and later in Peru. His stories
were so full of human interest and replete
with love and romance, that I became more
than ever interested in him. But my hearing
was bad, and it had been getting worse
since the day of the avalanche, so I prevailed
upon him to write. I could read
better than listen, besides he would write
his better thoughts and nobler sentiments
when he would not speak them.</p>
<p>It was writing these memoirs of his
eventful life that furnished him pastime
and I was employed in reading them, during
the two months of our imprisonment
in our snow bound cabin.</p>
<p>By the dim light of the window by day
and the blaze of a pine log at night, he
wrote upon the scraps of paper found
about the cabin. As I now review the pile
I find it made up of paper bags, margins of
newspapers, fly leaves from a few old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
books, and much of it on strips of a yellow
window shade, also on the backs of fancy
calendars with which Carson had adorned
our cabin, and almost a whole chapter I
find penciled finely on a pair of lady&rsquo;s
cuffs that were strangely out of place in a
miner&rsquo;s hut.</p>
<p>Buchan does not know that I am going
to give his story to the public and I shall
have to take chances and risk his displeasure.
In that event I have the defence of
pleading that no man has the right to withhold
so good a tale from the world.</p>

<h3>IN DAYS OF INNOCENCE.</h3>
</div>
<p>As I peer into the dim past that haunts
the scenes of my childhood in Aberdeen,
Scotland, a thousand memories troop by
like the scenes of a panorama with the
footlights turned low; and when I contemplate
them in a meditative hour it leaves me
with as lonesome a feeling as if I had listened
to the old time song, &ldquo;Home Sweet
Home,&rdquo; which I have heard a thousand
times in distant climes, sometimes sung to
crowded audiences at the opera, and again
by the pioneer as he rattled his prairie
schooner over the plains.</p>
<p>It is a song that never grows old and
never will so long as men leave the home
of their childhood, around whose hearthstones
still play ghost-like, the recollections
of bye-gone years, tenderly touching
their sympathies as they pause for a
moment in their monied pursuits in other
lands.</p>

SOUNDING THE DEPTHS<br />

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>The old red school house on Princeton
street, with the tall lank figure of Ellwood
for its presiding master and who believed
in and practiced the command of the Holy
Writ: &ldquo;Spare the rod and spoil the
child,&rdquo; was to me in those years of tenderness,
a dismal contemplation. But Sundays
had a brighter hue when Mother
would dress me in full Highland suit of
tartan, and adorn my cap with an eagle
feather, surmounted with a brooch of the
design of an arm with a dagger, bearing
the motto, &ldquo;We fear nae fae.&rdquo; With my
small claymore and buckled shoes and
plaid, how proudly I would walk up to the
barracks at Castle Gate, where the sentry
would salute me, and give me permission to
enter.</p>
<p>But those days had their troubles as
well as pleasures. The West North street
boys had a grievance against those of the
East North street and one Saturday both
sides met in battle array, armed with wooden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
swords, near the North church at Queen
street. After a determined resistance
West North street was victorious, when
someone presented us with a flag. It was
a common piece of bunting, but to our
young heroes it was something to be looked
up to and defended with our lives before
the honor of West North street should be
sullied.</p>
<p>That banner cost us many a headache,
and many a soiled suit of clothes after the
usual Saturday battle. On one occasion we
sallied forth as usual to the battlefield,
carrying our banner, and shouting derisively
at our foe. The enemy had been reinforced
and after a hard struggle, they
captured our flag and carried it off in
triumph to East North street.</p>
<p>Our fellows were a crest-fallen lot, as we
sat on the steps of the church looking the
picture of dejection. However, a few days
later, I summoned the boys to meet in an
old building in Ferrier&rsquo;s Lane. There
were fifteen of us and we came armed with
our wooden swords. After much debate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
over the loss of our flag, a committee was
appointed to notify the East North street
fellows, that we were ready to offer battle,
and dared them to meet us the following
Saturday and bring the captured flag. They
accepted the challenge. When we met
again in the old building by the hazy and
flickering light of a tallow candle, with upraised
swords we swore to re-capture our
flag, uphold the honor of our street or die in
the attempt. I was chosen captain on this
occasion, and never did a general rack his
brain more for a plan of success than I did
to win this battle. Finally I hit upon a
stratagem and after school submitted it to
all. It was to proceed to the usual place of
battle, but at the corner of Queen street
five boys were to be stationed out of sight,
and when both armies met they were to
rush in on their standard bearer and capture
the flag. We met, and even to this day
I shudder at the ferocity of that battle.
Twice I was knocked down; several times
our street was on the retreat when someone
shouted&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Remember our oath!&rdquo; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
then another desperate rush, and along
with the charge of the five secreted ones
which so surprised the East North street
boys that they finally yielded, and we carried
off our flag in triumph. John Taylor&rsquo;s
head was cut, John Ingerham&rsquo;s eyes were
black, my right knee cap was out of place
and six or eight others were more or less
wounded. The boys of East North street
fared about the same. Good old Doctor
Ellis living in King street witnessed the
fight, but he kept my secret, for I told
Mother that I was hurt in running a race.</p>
<p>And so those delightful days of early
boyhood passed like one long summer day.
But a change came. My father died and
in a few months more, my loving Mother,
after a lingering illness, passed away. I
then left the home of my childhood to live
with my older brother, James.</p>
<p>Although every possible kindness was
shown me, there was lacking a mother&rsquo;s
love, a mother&rsquo;s sympathy and cheering
words, things that touch the tender chords
of a boy&rsquo;s heart. At that time I was sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
to the Ledingham Academy, but it was useless.
The golden veil through which I had
looked out on the world was lifted, the
chain of love and affection broken. I saw
the great ships come with their strange men
from other ports of the world. I saw them
unfurl their snowy sails and speed over the
blue waters bound for the shores of other
climes. I watched them until they were but
a speck of white down on the blue horizon,
and I longed to be on board&ndash;&ndash;to feel the
ship roll upon the billows and hear the
wind whistling through the rigging, to climb
aloft and view the limitless expanse of
ocean and feel that I was a part of these
white specters of the sea.</p>
<p>One day I saw in the windows of Knox
&amp; Co., a sign which read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two apprentices wanted for the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went in and told them I wanted to become
a sailor. About this time another lad
about one year older than myself came in
on the same errand. An old gentleman,
after surveying us both for some moments,
remarked that in his opinion we were too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
young, but told us to wait a few minutes as
Captain McKenzie would be in soon.</p>
<p>When Captain McKenzie came in he
asked us if it was with the consent of our
parents that we made application. Being
answered in the affirmative by James
Mitchell, the other boy, I answered that my
father and mother were dead, but my
brother would sign the necessary papers.</p>

<h3>THROUGH MISTS OF THE SEA.</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain McKenzie sprang from his berth
in the wildest excitement. A moment before
a low voice called &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; at his
state room door. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Donovan,&rdquo; came the guarded reply.
&ldquo;Captain, the mate has conspired
with the crew to mutiny and your throat
will be cut in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Mitchell and I were apprentices
on board the bark &ldquo;Aven of Aberdeen.&rdquo;
My brother James having reluctantly consented
that I should follow the fortunes
of the sea, signed the indenture papers.</p>
<p>The brig was bound for Archangel, Russia,
and we had on board a large amount
of specie and plate, the private fortunes
of a Russian Jew returning to his native
land after many years of success as a merchant
in Alexandria. Our berth was near
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the captain&rsquo;s, and Mitchell had heard the
warning given by Donovan. He was out of
his berth in an instant and gave me to understand
there was mutiny aboard. Together
we entered the captain&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>The Jew was apprised of the situation.
It was the intention of the mate and crew
to murder him and the Captain and put
the vessel about for a piratical cruise in the
Indian Ocean. They were a motley gang
of foreigners, low bred and capable of any
crime when led by a man like the mate,
fresh from a career of lawlessness on the
China coast.</p>
<p>The Jew was the most abject picture of
terror I ever saw. His hands trembled and
he shook like a man in a chill. He wanted
to hide, but that was useless. Captain McKenzie
armed himself with a belaying pin.
He placed one in the hands of each of us
boys and bade us follow him in silence. We
cautiously went on deck and we found the
helm deserted, and the mate and the entire
crew sitting together and drinking in
the fore part of the ship.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Captain McKenzie sprang into their
midst and with one blow from the pin killed
the mate. This subdued the others and
they slunk away to their duties. The captain
then called the men in front of him
and after ordering Donovan to the helm,
told them he was done with them and that
their future conduct would determine their
fate. At the same time he threatened to
kill the first man that manifested a mutinous
disposition, or dared to cross a given
line on the deck without his permission. He
then ordered the mate&rsquo;s body overboard
and told the men to return to their duties.</p>
<p>The Captain and Donovan took turns at
the helm, while Mitchell or I was stationed
as a lookout to give instant warning of any
suspicious movements on the part of the
crew. For more than a week we stood to
our posts of duty, when one morning we
sailed into the smooth waters of the port
of Archangel, weary and exhausted from
the intense nervous strain and loss of
sleep.</p>
<p>The Captain notified the British consul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and a file of soldiers came on board and
arrested the crew. Six of them were afterwards
sent to prison for life.</p>
<p>The home voyage of the Aven was
fraught with all the dangers of the sea. We
had secured another crew in Archangel
but their seamanship was bad. When a
sudden storm would strike us it required
herculean efforts on the part of the captain
and Donovan to prevent the ship from
being driven ashore on the rocks.</p>
<p>Snow was falling and a wintry wind
dashed the waves over our decks and coated
the bulwarks with a mail of ice. Sleet
and snow clung to the rigging, making
every effort to handle the ship a hazardous
one. For three days we battled against the
elements and then we came in contact with
ice floes. Once our position was so perilous
that the Captain ordered the boats provisioned
and ready to be lowered when the
vessel should be crushed in the ice. By
skillful maneuvering we escaped from the
ice floes and had a pleasant day or two in
smoother seas.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>It was night and I was standing by the
taffrail, when suddenly a giant specter
seemed to come up from out of the sea,
bearing directly down upon us. Her great
lantern swung in a glow in a fog, by which
I discerned moving objects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collision! Collision!&rdquo; I shouted at the
top of my voice. The cry was taken up by
the sailors, and ere it had died away there
was the crashing of timbers, falling spars
and the shouts of men.</p>
<p>We had been struck a glancing blow
abaft midships but the damage was not serious
enough to sink us. The other vessel,
which proved to be the brig &ldquo;Rapid,&rdquo; belonging
to the same company at Aberdeen,
stood off until its crew ascertained the extent
of our damage, then sailed away in
the darkness.</p>
<p>A month&rsquo;s delay on the docks at Aberdeen
repairing damages, and we were
again on the high seas bound for the ports
of South America.</p>
<p>When off the West Indies the sky suddenly
became overcast, and we were soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
overtaken by a hurricane. The captain saw
it coming and prepared for it, yet when it
took the ship it roared and laid her down
so that I thought she would never get up
again. All that day and night we had
heavy squalls, and by morning the gale
was still increasing. Birds of sea and land
came on board. Driven by the winds, they
dashed themselves down upon the deck
without offering to stir until picked up,
and when let go they would not leave the
ship, but endeavored to hide from the wind.
By ten o&rsquo;clock at night the storm had spent
its fury, and when I went to my bunk I
found it full of water. With the straining
of the ship, the seams had begun to leak.
I was surprised to note among the ship&rsquo;s
crew that the most swaggering, swearing
bullies in fine weather were now the most
meek and mild-mannered of men when
death was staring them in the face.</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>Then followed days when the sea was
smooth as glass. Our white sails hung idly
beneath the scorching skies. Sea weed
floated on the oily surface, as, day by day,
we lay seemingly motionless on the bosom
of the deep. The moon rose out of a phosphorescent
sea and cast its long golden
gleams on the azure blue, while the stars
shone like isles of light in the sky. There
was a dread in the infinite spaces about.
Again, there was scurrying, fleecy clouds
and our ship was scudding before the
breeze.</p>
<p>When I awoke one morning, we were
lying at anchor in the harbor of Buenos
Ayres. While unloading cargo, the Captain
desiring to go ashore, I was taken in
the boat along with two of the seamen.
After getting to the wharf, the Captain
said: &ldquo;I expect you fellows to employ
your time cleaning that boat; it will be
five o&rsquo;clock before I return.&rdquo; After he
had gone, one of the sailors said to his
mate, &ldquo;We will leave Spriggings (meaning
me) to clean the boat, and we will go
to shore.&rdquo; After they were gone, I concluded
that I had been imposed upon and
I left the boat and went into the city, having
no intention of deserting the vessel at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
that time. In my wanderings in the strange
city, and not knowing a word of Spanish,
I lost my way. Finally, when I returned
to the wharf, the boat was gone. It was
late when I was picked up by a policeman
and turned over to an Englishman, who
kindly took me to his home for the night.
The next morning I returned to the Aven
and received a reprimand.</p>
<p>A few days later we weighed anchor for
Valparaiso. The sky was overcast and the
sea was rolling high off the Patagonian
coast, when we heard signal guns of distress.
Captain McKenzie changed the
course of the ship and we soon came in
view of the Spanish sloop Seville going to
pieces on the rocks. Her bow was lifted
high, while the waves were breaking over
her stern. Her sails were in shreds, and
a dozen sailors clung to the rigging. We
lowered the life-boat, and after hours of
battle with wind and wave, rescued the
crew. They were in an exhausted and
famished condition, having been for almost
three days without food or water. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
were given every kindly attention by our
officers and crew.</p>
<p>We saw the dark, jagged, rugged
bluffs and steeps of Staten and Terra del
Fuego. We rounded Cape St. John, amid
tempestuous gales and giant seas of the
polar regions. We lost sight of the land,
reefed the sails close down and then bid
defiance to the storm. Strange sea birds
shrieked their dismal cries, while dull leaden
skies added to the gloom. We cleared
Cape Horn in safety and were soon sailing
over the smooth seas of the south Pacific
Ocean beneath the Southern Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sail ho!&rdquo; cried the lookout. All eyes
were turned to the leeward. A stately
ship, under full sail, had suddenly appeared,
bearing down upon us. She came
silently, the water splitting in foam at her
bows. We could see the crew working
about her decks, but no sound came from
the spectre. All at once we noticed her hull
and sails were transparent. We could see
through them to the ocean beyond.</p>
<p>It was only a mirage of the sea, but to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
our crew it was the spectre of the Flying
Dutchman&ndash;&ndash;a phantom ship had crossed
our bow.</p>
<p>Once in port, no more would we walk
the deck of the Aven of Aberdeen. She
had seen a ghost.</p>

<h2>IV.</h2>
<h3>GRAVES GAVE UP THEIR DEAD.</h3>
</div>
<p>I was in the streets of Arica, Peru, when
the earth began to rock and reel. Buildings
surged and fell, with a crashing noise.
The dust rose dense, and darkened the
sky. The earth gaped and swallowed up
many of the people fleeing to the hills back
of the town. I followed to an elevation
where an awful sight met the terror-stricken
populace. The hills of Arica had for
centuries been the burying grounds of the
ancient Agmaras, a race of Indians who
ages ago it seems were fishermen. The
convulsions of the earth threw to the surface
hundreds of the dried bodies of the
Indians, still wrapped in their coarse garments,
the nature of the soil had prevented
decay. When the people beheld this they
believed the world had come to an end, and
they threw themselves on their faces praying
for mercy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></div>
<p>There was a thunderous roar from the
sea, growing louder and louder as each
moment of terror sped on, and then, with
one mighty crash, a tidal wave fifty feet
high,&ndash;&ndash;the aftermath of the earthquake&ndash;&ndash;struck
the shore, bearing upon its crest the
U. S. Battleship Wateree, one German and
two British vessels, leaving them stranded
far inland. A sailor from the Wateree was
in a boat, and as he was swept past his
vessel he waved the Stars and Stripes in
farewell to his comrades on board.</p>
<p>The shocks had ceased and the storm
that followed had spent its fury, when the
pall of night came over the stricken city.
Human wolves crept from their hiding
places and began their work of prowling
amid the ruins and robbing the dead. All
night long they held high carnival amid
the scenes of terror and desolation.</p>
<p>Through it all I had been a silent, bewildered
spectator. I had fled to the hills
only because others did, for I could speak
but little of the language of the country.
I was among the graves when morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
dawned and I heard a voice in my own
language. Going to the spot I found a man
with a sprained ankle fighting away a
thief. I seized a rock and he ran. I aided
the injured man to a place of safety, where
we remained for several days until a conveyance
took us back to town.</p>
<p>The man whom I had helped was John
L. Thorndike, an American, well known in
Peru and all over South America, as having
built the highest standard-gauge railway
in the world, and a man who at once
became my warmest friend.</p>
<p>But to return to my ship. When the
Aven of Aberdeen reached Valparaiso, the
mate and a number of sailors immediately
deserted the vessel in a boat. The Captain
saw them leaving but was powerless to stop
them. That night John Mitchell and I
stood watch alone. There being no boat it
did not occur to them that we would attempt
to escape, but about midnight Mitchell
said to me, &ldquo;Spriggings, I dare you to
run away.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the dare,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but how
will we get ashore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll launch one of the hatches,&rdquo; he
replied.</p>
<p>It was no sooner said than we tied a rope
around one of the heavy hatches, and bearing
it to the side of the ship, we lowered it
noiselessly into the water, then let ourselves
down the rope and by holding to the
hatch, one on either side, we safely swam
ashore.</p>
<p>We avoided the business streets of Valparaiso
and made our way to the country,
where we hid in a grove until night. We
were without money, our clothes were such
as we wore at sea, night was coming on,
we were hungry and with no place to sleep.
Our only thought had been to escape from
the Aven, for we had imbibed the superstition
of sailors, and nothing could induce us
to remain aboard that vessel since the
phantom ship had crossed our bow.</p>
<p>I saw a light in a farmhouse in the distance
and on our approach the inmates
were aroused by the barking of their dog.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
The man was a typical Chilean, short and
stout. He looked curiously at us and by
signs Mitchell made him understand that
we were hungry. He entered the house
and returned with his wife and two children.
Mitchell repeated his signs and the
woman went inside and returned with a
cup of milk, which we drank greedily. The
man then beckoned us inside where we had
a supper of meat, bread and coffee. They
collected a number of sheep skins, gave
us two mats for covering, and we slept
soundly.</p>
<p>The next morning we helped the man in
his garden, drew water for the cattle and
made ourselves useful in other ways. I
went almost every day for two weeks to the
summit of the hill where I had seen a splendid
view of the bay, to see if the Aven was
still in port. One day I saw her spread her
sails and I watched her until she was but
a speck on the horizon.</p>
<p>Our host by this time, I think, knew we
had run away, for on one occasion he followed
me when I making my observation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
but if he suspected anything he never took
any steps to have us arrested, and in fact
treated us with great kindness. When we
left he gave us a large package of food and
some clean stockings and shirts which his
wife had made for us.</p>
<p>It was nightfall when we entered Valparaiso.
Near the plaza Victoria we paused
before an English boarding house sign. As
we stood looking, a middle-aged man came
out and asked us our business. Before we
could reply he said: &ldquo;I bet you are the
two boys from the Aven.&rdquo; Our frightened
looks told him we were. He invited us in
and gave us supper.</p>
<p>We soon learned to our dismay that this
man was the notorious Cockney Spider,
keeper of a runaway sailor&rsquo;s boarding
house. At night Cockney would start out
to some vessel in the bay of Valparaiso,
everything having been pre-arranged, take
off those sailors desiring to runaway, secrete
them in the house and when opportunity
offered, ship them again. The
amount of bounty paid by ships short of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
men was often large, and as Cockney always
arranged to have poor runaways deep
in debt for board and lodging, the sailor on
being re-shipped was worse off, and Cockney
the gainer. He often took desperate
chances in stealing sailors, as the coast
guard and other officials were sharp. Many
in that traffic were captured, but Cockney
always escaped.</p>
<p>After we spent the night in his home he
asked me if I could write. Replying in
the affirmative, I was installed as chief
book-keeper of the notorious runaway sailor
boarding house. My duties were to register
the sailors brought to the house, keep
a record of their meals, charge so much a
night for lodging, and present their bill
when they were ready to leave. I held the
position for two weeks, when one night
Cockney came home intoxicated and told
me that he had shipped Mitchell that night
on a French bark. A sailor gave me a sly
wink and whispered, &ldquo;Your turn will come
next, he intends to ship you on a whaler.&rdquo;
My experience with the ice on the Aven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
had given me a horror of frozen seas, and
that night I stole away from the boarding
house.</p>
<p>I was in dread of Cockney Spider, and,
in my determination to escape, I became
a stowaway on a coast steamer and landed
at Arica, with a few dollars in my pocket,
paid to me by Spider.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Mollendo in company
with Mr. John L. Thorndike, he introduced
me to Mr. Hill, his general manager,
as his &ldquo;boy protector&rdquo; and told him
to give me employment and see that I was
well provided for.</p>
<p>In a short while I was in the railway
shops, learning the trade of machinist, and
later I was engineer on the railroad running
from the sea port of Mollendo to
Arequipa, more than one hundred miles in
the interior. The city is situated in a beautiful
and fertile valley in the heart of the
Andes. The majestic volcanic mountain
Misti some miles away rises nearly four
miles above the sea and smoke still issues
from its crater.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>I had lately been transferred from the
shops in Mollendo to Arequipa, when, hearing
fabulous stories of rich gold finds in
the Andes, and being imbued with an adventurous
spirit, I resolved to try my fortune
in the new El Dorado.</p>

<h2>V.</h2>
<h3>FAIREST FLOWER OF THE CORDILLERAS.</h3>
</div>
<p>I was in the heart of the Cordilleras,
weary, footsore and alone. I was descending
a rocky cliff a few hundred feet from a
plateau, while the thunders roared with
terrific crash. The rain fell in sheets,
plunging in wild fury in cataracts down the
mountain side. There was desolation and
terror unutterable. I leaned close to a
shelving rock, and as I thought of once
happy days in Aberdeen, of the love bestowed
upon me by my dear mother&ndash;&ndash;gone
forever from this world&ndash;&ndash;my own condition,
now a homeless wanderer in a foreign
land, perhaps to soon meet death and my
body be devoured by condors, I laid my
head on my arms and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>I am not superstitious, neither do I believe
that my condition at that time caused
my mind to wander; a peaceful calm came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
over me; it seemed as if some loving one
was near, fear vanished, and I looked up
but beheld nothing. The storm raged with
even greater fury. I walked and even began
to sing the &ldquo;Garb of Old Gaul.&rdquo; I ignored
the elements in their war and had
almost reached the plateau when the storm
ceased and the sun suddenly appeared.
Calm and warmth came from what a few
minutes before had seemed death and destruction.</p>
<p>A sudden turn in the trail and I beheld
a child seated beneath the thick, spreading
branches of a tree, her white apron filled
with alpine flowers. &ldquo;How came she
here,&rdquo; I wondered. Her dark bright eyes
gazed questioningly into mine, eyes
through which one could see the childish
spirit and feel the witchery of her magic
look; her raven locks fell in clusters over
her fair temples and ended in ringlets
about her shoulders; on her cheeks were
the glowing tints of youth and health. As
I spoke she rose and handed me a flower of
delicate tint. I gallantly pinned it on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
lapel of my coat, which won from her a
pleasing look and smile. I could speak a
little Spanish and she seemed to understand
that I was going her way. Together
we walked along the trail. Her childish
grace appealed to me. A spirit of infinite
goodness seemed to radiate from within
and stirred my noblest impulses. A feeling
of content settled upon me.</p>
<p>Near by, I saw some Indian huts and the
tambo or tavern where Frank Dunn and I
had stopped on our way to Puno. The
child ran ahead, leaving me to follow.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The first sight of Puno had satisfied me
that we had come to the most desolate
spot in the world, Nature&rsquo;s remains seemed
to have been brought there and left without
burial. The ground was thickly covered
with a short, wild grass and appeared
to be the natural dwelling place of the
alpacas and wild vicunas.</p>
<p>I had been in Puno but a few days when
I was offered work on board one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
steamers, but I longed again for Arequipa
and friends. Dunn had secured work on
one of the steamers and refused to return.
I thought this was hard, as it was my
money that had helped him from the time
he left Arequipa until he secured employment.
My money was almost gone, but I
had gone to the Amaras market and bought
what edibles I needed, and without hesitation
had started alone to return to Arequipa,
over those fearful heights and
dread solitudes of the Cordilleras, when I
found her.</p>
<p>When we were entering the tambo an
elderly gentleman and the Indian host
were speaking in Spanish, and even from
my limited knowledge of the language I
knew they were talking about me.</p>
<p>No doubt but my appearance in the heart
of the Cordilleras wet, forlorn looking and
alone aroused his sympathy. After a difficult
attempt at opening a conversation, the
beautiful child I had met looking on all
the time, I was given to understand that
he desired me to eat with them. Of course
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
I consented, but I did not do justice to the
meal as the dark eyes of the young girl
were constantly upon me.</p>
<p>The gentleman gave me his name, Julian
Maldonado, and that of his daughter, Felicita
Maldonado. He was a well-to-do merchant
of elderly years. I learned that his
wife was dead and that their home was in
Lima. The servants made me a bed in the
room adjacent to my host. The next morning
I was aroused by one of them who said
his master wanted to see me. I went to
him and after telling him I was on my way
to Arequipa, and when there I would be
among my friends, he offered to purchase
a mule for me, but the only one to be had
was lame. However, I told him I was
young and would soon reach my destination.
Felicita then came in and announced
breakfast, after which the mules were
packed and, everything being in readiness,
we bade each other good-bye. Felicita
came toward me, and as she extended her
hand in her childish fashion, she placed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
my own a Peruvian twenty-dollar gold
piece, saying: &ldquo;Adios mi amigo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was almost speechless. I started forward
to return the money, but I had to
retain it, as they quickly mounted and
were gone before I could master my feelings.</p>
<p>Roll on, relentless Time. Felicita, fairest
flower of the Cordilleras, we shall meet
again, when love&rsquo;s young dream shall awaken
amid the clash of arms and tragedies!</p>
<p>Nine days later I arrived in Arequipa,
sick, footsore and weary. My friends had
sent out searching parties believing that I
had been murdered. Their astonishment
was great when they found where I had
been and that I had spent many nights
alone amid the dangers of the mountains.
Many were the admonitions I received from
older heads.</p>
<p>I laughed at their words, and when I
thought of the beautiful Felicita, I dreamed
of love and felt an indescribable content
with my surroundings and all the world.</p>

<h2>VI.</h2>
<h3>A HUMILIATING INCIDENT.</h3>
</div>
<p>There was a night riot in the streets of
Ilo, knives gleamed in ruffian hands, curses
and blasphemy fell from sodden lips. Shots
were fired in the thick of the struggling
mass, as the mob crowded in frenzy about
some central figure. The crowd from behind
pressed forward and Thompson and
I were carried along by the crush of humanity,
until of necessity we began to fight
our way out. We had partially succeeded,
when we were surrounded by soldiers. At
sight of the soldiers the crowd began to
disperse, but unfortunately for us it was
too late, besides we had nothing to do with
the riot, and thought we had nothing to
fear.</p>
<p>The officer stepped up and placed
Thompson and I under arrest. We were
searched, but no arms were found on us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
However, we were marched away to jail
and our feet placed in iron bars, fastened
with a heavy lock, which compelled us to lie
on our backs.</p>
<p>The next morning an officer appeared
and I notified him that I was a British subject,
and resented such treatment. He told
me that I was held for attempted murder.
Thompson was also under the same
charge. An Italian had been shot and
would probably die. I demanded an immediate
trial. Several officers of the railway
came and endeavored to set us free,
but their efforts were of no avail. There
was no British consul nearer than Arica,
about two days travel by steamer, and no
means for communicating with him until
the steamer arrived from the north.</p>
<p>Our prison was an old wooden structure,
and only one guard was over us. The officer
and his men had quarters some distance
away. It was our intention to ask
the soldier on guard for a drink of water
about midnight, when Thompson would
overpower him and take his keys. A small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
boat was to be in readiness at a certain
place. Our plan was, after obtaining the
keys, to put the soldier in the stocks and
walk out, all of which could easily have
been accomplished, as the soldier was but
a small ignorant half-breed Indian. It was
Sunday night and we had decided to put
our plan in operation, when&ndash;&ndash;imagine our
surprise&ndash;&ndash;an officer informed us to get
ready to take the train for Moquequa.</p>
<p>We were accompanied by an officer and
six men. I asked the officer what the removal
was for, and he said our trial was to
be held and it was necessary for us to be
present. I asked permission to speak with
the engineer, which was given. I told him
I dreaded being taken into the interior, as
we would be away from our friends, and
begged him when we came to a certain
grade along the line to increase the speed
and I would jump off. I was familiar with
that part of the country, knew I could secure
a horse and go to Mollendo or Arequipa.
I knew also that the officer and his
men had never been on a train, and it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
be impossible for them to give chase.</p>
<p>But we were again doomed to disappointment.
The engineer feared to carry
out the plan and instead of increasing
speed, went slower than usual.</p>
<p>On our arrival at Moquequa we were
marched through the streets, to my great
humiliation, as I knew many people in the
town. Numbers of them came and offered
their sympathy. To our great indignation
we were thrown into a cell with six other
prisoners convicted of murder, and a more
ugly, villainous and desperate-looking lot
of characters would have been hard to find
anywhere. No attention had been paid to
my remonstrance, when an hour later a
gentleman, whom I had favored, presented
himself. After I told him the circumstances
of our detention he said he would
send a lawyer to defend us. In the meantime
he arranged with a hotel keeper to
send us regular meals, also mattresses and
blankets.</p>
<p>The day following I had many visitors,
some drawn by curiosity and others by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
sympathy and good will. The latter were
profuse in their attentions. When a lawyer
appeared, I related to him the details
of our arrest. I did the talking, as Thompson
could not speak the language, while I
was becoming quite proficient in it. Upon
leaving, the lawyer promised to have us
free in eight days at most.</p>
<p>I passed away the dreary time pacing
that prison cell. It was about twenty feet
long and twelve feet wide, and contained
nothing but stone walls and floor, with a
heavy iron-grated window which looked
out on the plaza. A bottle of wine came
with each meal, instead of coffee, and I
shared it with the criminals in our cell. In
this way I soon won their good will, and as
they had all been convicted of murder, they
did not hesitate to tell me of their horrible
crimes.</p>
<p>There is no capital punishment in Peru.
Sentence for life, in that country, means
about fifteen years, and seldom do they
serve that length of time. Usually a revolution
releases them. At such times insurgents
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
invariably break open the prisons
and liberate the convicts, which happened
to these prisoners a few months later. We
were visited daily by my lawyer and finally
were told that four hundred dollars
would be required for our liberation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liberate us and I will give you the
money,&rdquo; was my answer.</p>
<p>Next day I bid adieu to my undesirable
residence and companions; Thompson had
no money and I paid all. After purchasing
new clothes and receiving the congratulations
of friends, we boarded the train for
Ilo. Mr. Hill returned from Lima that
day and after learning of the indignities inflicted
upon me, told his officials that they
should have notified the British consul and
compelled the Peruvian authorities to pay,
instead of taking my money.</p>
<p>I returned to work in the shops, and
three weeks afterward one of the office
clerks came in breathless and told me I
was to be arrested again along with Thompson.
The papers would be down from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
Moquequa that night and tomorrow morning
they would come for us.</p>
<p>I was furious when I realized that we
were again facing punishment for a crime
of which we were innocent and I determined
to resist arrest, and leave Ilo.</p>
<p>I went to the office of the secretary of
the railroad, and after a long consultation,
it was agreed to have three of Mr. Hill&rsquo;s
best horses in readiness at midnight. One
of the hostlers was to accompany us and
when we reached Tambo, Thompson and
I would take the train for Arequipa.</p>
<p>I went to my room, packed my clothes,
carefully loaded two revolvers and placed
my trunk and other articles of value in
the hands of my friends, with orders to
send them to Arequipa after the sensation
of my escape was over. After supper, to
allay any suspicion the authorities might
have, I strolled along the wharf, went into
a billiard hall and actually played a game
of billiards with the captain of the guard,
who I have no doubt had the order to arrest
me in his pocket. Thompson had gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
to his room. I followed thirty minutes later,
and at precisely twelve o&rsquo;clock, I sallied
out of the house by the rear, and met
Thompson at the agreed place on the beach.</p>
<p>The night was dark, and everything being
in readiness, we mounted and rode
through the town dressed like natives. We
soon gained the highway leading to Tambo
and after being well clear of Ilo, we put
our horses to their best. We rode the fifty-five
miles to Tambo, over a rugged and
mountainous country and caught the train
for Arequipa, arriving that night after an
absence for me of two years.</p>

<h2>VII.</h2>
<h3>IN THE THROES OF REVOLUTION.</h3>
</div>
<p>The railroad had now been extended
from Arequipa to Puno. A revolution had
broken out and insurgents were cutting the
telegraph wires.</p>
<p>I was engineer on a combination locomotive
and coach and as this locomotive will
be in the scene of more than one tragedy,
I will describe it. It was specially designed
for the president and officers of the road,
weighing only eight tons. On the same
frame with the engine, in fact, a part of it,
was built a beautiful black walnut coach,
with a seating capacity of from twelve to
eighteen persons. It had two side doors
and one in front, which, when opened, communicated
with the engineer. There were
windows hung with beautiful damask curtains,
the carpets were of rich velvet,
and a center table and several cupboards
under the seats completed the furnishings.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
It was in reality a palace on wheels, named
The Arequipena, meaning a native of Arequipa.
I mention the design of the combination
engine-car for the reason that, on a
duplicate of The Arequipena, later occurred
one of the most perilous and tragic
events of my life.</p>
<p>The stretch of road from Julica to Cabanillas
was level and straight, except about
two miles from Cabanillas station, where a
heavy side cut and sharp curve was the
only obstruction to the view for miles. I
was going at the rate of forty miles an
hour, when, on nearing this curve, I beheld
a large Rogers locomotive with a train of
coaches coming toward me. I cannot describe
the thoughts that went through my
brain&ndash;&ndash;there was a terrific crash&ndash;&ndash;flying
debris&ndash;&ndash;a hissing of steam&ndash;&ndash;mingled with
the groans of the wounded and dying.</p>
<p>I was thrown out of the way of the
wreck and near the edge of a river, and
when I regained my senses a priest was
bending over me, bathing my forehead. I
gradually realized what had happened and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
went to my engine. There was scarcely a
vestige left of The Little Arequipena, only
a piece of the boiler and two pairs of driving
wheels. The shock was so great that
the little coach was hurled over the other
engine, which was not damaged much.</p>
<p>I saw several persons bending over some
one, and, on going closer, found William
Cuthbert, our traveling engineer, stretched
on the ground dying. Five soldiers
were dead beneath the ruins. One officer,
with his legs broken in two places, begged
that others be cared for first. The road-master
was in agony, his lower limbs
frightfully burned by escaping steam; all
the others were more or less seriously injured,
except myself. When relief came
our dead and wounded were taken to Arequipa.</p>
<p>We had been sent out to repair the wires,
and orders had come to me that we should
be given the right of way. The engineer
who collided with me told me that the commander
of the government forces had ordered
our superintendent to furnish transportation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
for his troops to Puno at once,
and when informed that it would be impossible
to send a train until we were heard
from, he threatened to place the superintendent
in jail unless his orders were complied
with. No one on the other train was
hurt. They had six coaches full of soldiers,
the priest who assisted me being
among them.</p>
<p>The day after our arrival at Arequipa
the funeral of William Cuthbert took place.
The procession was the largest that I had
ever witnessed at any funeral in Arequipa,
natives as well as foreigners taking part.</p>
<p>It was a long time before I recovered
from the shock, not alone of the collision,
but the death of William Cuthbert who always
had been ready to befriend me and
who had given me much valuable information.
He lies buried in the cemetery at
Arequipa, in a vault. A marble slab was
erected to his memory.</p>
<p>The general manager sent for me one
day to come to his office in Arequipa, and
after talking over the cause of the collision,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
I told him that I considered him to blame
for allowing any engine and train to go
out without knowing first where we were,
and that it would have been better to have
gone to prison, that if he had been sent
there the American government would
have demanded his freedom, and he would
have been honored. As it stood, he was
to a certain extent responsible for that
dreadful affair. After some more words I
left the office, realizing that I had incurred
the displeasure of the head officer.
I concluded to leave, which I was sorry to
do, as I looked upon Arequipa as my only
home.</p>
<p>I visited Valparaiso and again met Cockney
Spider. He was still at his old business,
conducting a runaway sailors&rsquo; boarding
house. A few weeks later found me in
Panama, an engineer on the Panama and
Aspinwall railroad. The climate, I believe,
is the most wretched in the world,
and tropical vegetation grows the rankest.
In a few months I was stricken with the
yellow fever, but thanks to my robust constitution
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
I soon recovered. About this
time I met an official of the government
railway at Ilo, who desired me to return
and accept a position as engineer on the
road. I told him of my troubles in that
town with the officials. He met me soon
afterwards, with a contract duly drawn up
for eighteen months&rsquo; service and a guarantee
that I should not be molested by any
petty official.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Ilo, imagine my surprise
to find that the man who rowed me
ashore was the Italian who caused my arrest.
He offered to shake hands but I refused.
When I went to the hotel many of
my old native friends came to see me, and
informed me that after I had left they discovered
the person who did the shooting.
It was done by one of their own number,
who managed to get away.</p>
<p>It was very gratifying to thus have my
innocence established, but it did not recompense
for the time I had spent in jail and
the loss of money.</p>
<p>I had been running a train out of Ilo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
about a month, when one night I was invited
to a &ldquo;wake.&rdquo; Having never attended
one, I accepted the invitation. At one
end of the room stood a large table, and
upon it the body of a child two years old.
On its head was a wreath of flowers. The
child was dressed in white; in its tiny
hands was a bouquet of flowers; the feet
were encased in small white slippers; lighted
candles surrounded the body. At either
end of the table were several old women,
who were employed by the family as
mourners, and they kept up a continual
low moaning sound. Occasionally they
would stop to partake of wine, and start
again, more dismal than ever. The room
was large and on each side were seated ladies
and gentlemen talking and laughing
and seemingly enjoying themselves. The
parents of the dead child appeared to have
surpassed the expectations of their friends
and made a great success of the &ldquo;wake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a custom in Peru that when several
persons are gathered together there
is constant drinking. A large bottle of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
wine or whiskey is placed on the table
with one glass. A lady or gentleman will
fill the glass and drink to the health of
some one present. It is bad form to leave
any liquor in the glass, so it is always
drained, refilled and presented to the one
whose health has been drunk. It is an insult
to refuse to drink, after one has drank
to your health and the person accepting the
glass drinks to the health of some one else.
In this manner the glass is constantly on
the move. On this occasion, the wine was
on the table with the corpse.</p>
<p>About one o&rsquo;clock in the morning not
seeing any disposition on the part of the
guests to retire, I bade our friends good
night.</p>
<p>I had barely reached the street when I
heard firing and saw people running. Suddenly
there came a volley of musketry, and
a woman dropped dead a few feet in front
of me. Almost immediately the streets
were deserted, but I could hear the cries
of &ldquo;Vivia Pierola,&rdquo; and I knew another
revolution had broken out.</p>

<h2>VIII.</h2>
<h3>VIVA GENERALISSIMO PIEROLA.</h3>
</div>
<p>I did not do anything for the woman.
Shot through the heart, she was past all
aid. I made a dash into a by-street, intending
to reach the station, get my engine
ready and go to Ilo to prevent the
insurgents from using the road to transport
their troops. But I ran into an officer&rsquo;s
arms before I had gone a block. He
had been looking for me all night, and told
me I was his prisoner. I was to be taken
before Senor Pierola. Meantime I was to
be treated with every consideration, the
officer paying for breakfast and cigars,
and insisting on my drinking some ale
which he had taken as a contraband of
war.</p>
<p>It was some time before we could get
near the great leader of the revolution,
the approaches to his house being crowded
with people. Ladies were prominent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
among the crowd, carrying flowers and
declaring their deliverer had come to make
Peru the greatest nation on the Pacific.</p>
<p>After the officer presented me Pierola
asked me if I spoke Spanish. Upon being
answered in the affirmative, he asked my
name, nationality and how long I had been
employed by the Peruvian government; all
of which being answered to his satisfaction,
he asked me if I would work for him,
and if I would, in the event of his being
victorious, I should be appointed to take
charge of the Ilo and Moquequa railways.
He only wanted me to convey troops down
the valley, take up some of the rails to prevent
the government troops from using the
line, and then before he retreated to another
position which he would fortify, to
dismantle the engine and hide the parts, so
that in case the government troops should
come to Moquequa the engine would be of
no service to them.</p>
<p>I replied that I was a British subject,
and that if I were to do what he requested
of me, and should be taken prisoner by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
government, and the fact became known
that I had taken part, I would be unable
to claim the protection of my government.
He agreed that that was true, but he would
insure against that by sending a few troops
with me, and it would look as if force was
compelling me to do what, which without
force, I would not have done.</p>
<p>I finally agreed, and after giving my
word that I would not attempt to escape,
received orders to take the engine, as a
squad of soldiers would accompany me,
and at a certain place along the line which
they would designate, the rails would be
torn up. We started that afternoon.</p>
<p>We carried two flat cars to load the rails
on. About forty miles from Moquequa we
discovered another train coming toward
us, but upon our nearer approach they
backed off rapidly. It was a party of government
troops sent out to ascertain
whether the road was clear in order to
bring up their main body. Our company
then took up rails and made the road dangerous
in ten different places. We blew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
up a small wooden bridge with giant powder.</p>
<p>The officer in charge made frequent stops
in the valley and levied a tribute of money
on all the wine merchants he could find.
They usually gave, as they knew too well
the consequence of refusing. Those who
hid away found, on their return, their wine
presses and vaults in ruins.</p>
<p>On our return to Moquequa, I was ordered
to disable the engine, which I did by
taking off both valve stems and driving
rods. The officer hid them and that was
the last I ever saw of them. We attended
a dance which lasted all night, and drank
much wine in anticipation of the success
of the revolution. It was a gala night.
There was dancing and music in nearly all
the houses.</p>
<p>In the early morning bugles, drums and
other instruments began making a hideous
noise, officers were commanding men to
form ranks, horses, mules and donkeys
were running hither and thither, and dogs
were barking. Here and there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
groups of men learning to load their rifles,
others endeavoring to parry and thrust
with cutlasses and making fierce swings at
an imaginary government soldier. Louder
and hoarser came the call of the officers,
but their commands were lost on the motley
crowd. After several hours the officers
succeeded in getting the men into some
kind of marching order.</p>
<p>I turned to a store to buy some cigars,
when I heard someone calling, and turning
I beheld three of my fellow prisoners that
a few months before were in jail convicted
of murder. One straightened out his hand
to me, but I did not take it. I asked them
how they escaped; it was the old story. The
insurgents needed recruits and they were
liberated on condition that they fight for
Pierola.</p>
<p>Such was Peru, and such it is today. Instead
of the people supporting the government,
the government supports the people,
and when all its favors become exhausted,
then some one arises and proclaims himself
president, organizes a band of thieves and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
murderers, and endeavors to gain control.</p>
<p>There have been exceptions, when an indignant
people, who have been trodden to
such an extent that it seems a revolution
is the only means of righting their wrongs;
but nine out of ten are the work of an ambitious
man who wants to become ruler.</p>
<p>I asked the ex-convicts where the other
three were who had been confined with
them. Two had died and the other was
with the troops. They begged for money
and I gave them a dollar each, and after
profusely thanking me they left to follow
the rear guard of Pierola&rsquo;s scoundrels.</p>
<p>After purchasing my cigars, I followed
the main body of troops with my escort of
twenty soldiers, to keep guard over me, as
arranged with General Pierola. Our destination
was Torato, thirty miles from Moquequa.
The road led over passes and
wound around mountain sides, and from
several points of vantage I could see the
army on the march, with General Pierola
and a priest by his side in the lead. The
priest was there to inspire courage in those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
who might waver. The army numbered six
hundred infantry and two hundred cavalry,
many of whom did not know the duties of
a soldier.</p>
<p>On arriving at Torato, I secured quarters
for myself and escort at the expense
of the insurgent general. A month passed
in wine drinking and dancing. There
were gay festivities every night, lasting
sometimes until late the next morning, the
officers seldom seeing their men. Instead
of drilling them, they spent their time telling
how they were going to annihilate the
government troops. Some little fortifying
had been done, but the natural surroundings
were sufficient to prevent a prudent
attack. One day the news came that the
government troops were advancing and
then some little work was done to prepare
for battle.</p>
<p>The day before the battle, I told General
Pierola I had no objections to following
him to the battlefield, but in consideration
of being a non-combatant, I asked the privilege
of selecting my own course, giving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
him my word of honor that I would not
make any attempt to escape. He was satisfied
and gave me a pass allowing the
freedom I desired. The next day the cry
arose that the government troops were
only six miles away. There was hurrying
to and fro with no discipline. The priest
accomplished more by his cross than all
the officers. There was a babel of voices.
All were trying to give commands. Suddenly
heavy firing was heard, the outpost
had become engaged at last.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />
<div class='chsp'>

<a name='IX_AMID_THE_DIN_OF_BATTLE' id='IX_AMID_THE_DIN_OF_BATTLE'></a>
<h2>IX.</h2>
<h3>AMID THE DIN OF BATTLE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The main body of the insurgent troops
began to move to the front, headed by General
Pierola and the priest marching to the
most unearthly music I ever heard. Women
were conspicuous and cheered as the
men marched past. &ldquo;Viva Pierola!&rdquo; was
heard on all sides.</p>
<p>Then came an order to double quick.
The outposts were driven in a short distance,
and the enemy was in a valley, surrounded
on both sides by a chain of hills
with a huge mountain in the background.
When I saw the position of the government
troops, I was satisfied they would be defeated
and the battle become a rout. There
were two regiments of infantry and one of
cavalry in the valley. Pierola stationed
his troops on each side of the pass and in
front, reserving his cavalry. In a short
time the engagement became general. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
priest encouraged the insurgents by displaying
the cross. He was a courageous
fellow, always to be found in places of
danger. I mounted a huge boulder and
could easily see all that was going on. The
government troops would waver and fall
back, and again they would renew the attempt
to scale the hillsides, which was impossible
as long as the insurgents held their
position.</p>
<p>There was a strange happening just
when success seemed assured. The insurgent
cavalry had taken no part up to this
time, as both sides of the valley had been
actively engaged. The insurgents along
the pass were running short of ammunition.
An order was sent to the captain of
the cavalry to send a company back to Torato
and assist in hurrying up supplies.
There was a brief cessation of hostilities.
I could plainly see the government troops
carrying their dead and wounded to the
rear, but still holding their position. When
another charge was made to take the
heights, the firing again became general.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Suddenly arose the cry, &ldquo;They come!
They come!&rdquo; Firing along the sides of the
pass ceased, and I looked in amazement.
Evidently, something was wrong. The insurgents
were throwing away their arms
and running. There was a cloud of dust in
the direction of Torato, and I could easily
distinguish a company of cavalry, which I
knew was the company sent to hurry up the
ammunition. The insurgents saw them and
imagined that the government cavalry had
succeeded in getting to their rear. The
panic became a rout. In vain did Pierola
plead, as he threw himself in front of his
demoralized men, in vain did the priest
hold his crucifix on high, threatening and
pleading, but no persuasion could stop
those runaway cowards. The government
troops realized something was wrong, and
began to scale the heights. Still, if the
cavalry which had done no fighting, could
have been led to the side of the pass, the
day would still have been with Pierola, and
probably the stampede would have been
checked. But unfortunately for the would-be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
president, there was no one in command
capable of meeting the emergency.</p>
<p>I became excited, and snatching a cutlass
from the hand of a retreating soldier,
threw myself in front of a column in a
vain endeavor to stop them, but they ran
over me like so many sheep. Terror had
lent them wings of flight and deprived them
of reason. By this time the government infantry
had reached the plateau and was
forming into companies. Their cavalry
had seized the heights and the day was
lost.</p>
<p>I saw General Pierola shake hands with
the priest and leave the field. The priest
mounted and he, too, was gone. The
ground was strewn with arms; even the
discordant musical instruments were discarded.</p>
<p>Thus an army of revolutionists, who, a
few hours before paraded through the
streets of Torato, cheered by fair women,
and shouting &ldquo;Viva Pierola,&rdquo; had won a
battle by natural surroundings and lost it
by their cowardice. I, too, thought it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
time to retreat, as my escort of twenty soldiers
had long since disappeared. I rode
to Torato.</p>
<p>Along the way I overtook straggling
bands of insurgents going into town to
hide, while others were scaling the tallest
mountains. I went to my quarters, and
soon the town was surrounded.</p>
<p>The next morning about two hundred insurgents
were captured. The others were
hid in some mysterious way and the commanding
officer of the government troops
was made to believe that the main body of
the insurgents was in the mountains.</p>
<p>I sought the general of the government
troops to inform him of my presence. He
replied that he knew of my being a prisoner,
and asked me to return to Moquequa
at once and help to get the railway in operation
to convey his troops and prisoners.</p>
<p>I was glad no other questions were put
to me, and after pleading with the general
for my kind host who had treated me with
great kindness in Torato, and who was not
in sympathy with the revolutionists, he
agreed to exempt him from the payment of
money levied on nearly all the inhabitants.</p>

THE EARTH BEGAN TO ROCK AND REEL. (Page 33)<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Soon after this a troop ship arrived in
Ilo to convey prisoners and escort to Lima.
I felt sorry for the prisoners. Many of
them recognized me and kept calling, &ldquo;Don
Juan, please try and help us,&rdquo; but of
course I was powerless to do anything for
them. I was glad when they were aboard
the transport for I felt miserable in the
midst of so much suffering. But I knew
they would not suffer long. Another revolution
would set them free.</p>
<p>The railroad was again in running order
and everything progressing smoothly when
one morning at breakfast I was informed
that Pierola had broken out again. This
time his party had, by means unknown,
captured the Peruvian ironclad ram, Huascar.
He must have been aided by the officers,
or at least one of them who declared
in his favor. Howbeit, he had possession.
The Peruvian fleet was sent in pursuit, but
as the Huascar was the most powerful vessel
of the fleet, they had to give her up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>The fortunes of Pierola were brighter
now than ever. He could, with the exception
of Callao, have entire command
and control of all the sea ports along the
coast. But unfortunately for him, he began
to stop the British mail, and later the
French mail on the high seas, his object being
to intercept mail for the Peruvian government.</p>
<p>The British government dispatched H.
M. S. Amythist and the Shah to compel
him to surrender, the Huascar having had
full sway along the coast for a month.</p>
<p>The Huascar finally made her appearance
in the port of Ilo, and almost immediately
the Amythist and Shah hove in
sight. I had a good view from the beach
and saw a boat lowered from the Shah and
pull directly to the Huascar, I supposed for
the purpose of demanding her surrender.
However, if that was the object, it failed,
for upon the return of the boat to the Shah,
the Amythist cleared for action.</p>
<p>The afternoon was calm; not a ripple on
the ocean. The Huascar was nearest the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
shore, less than a mile from where I stood.
The Shah was over a mile distant seaward.
A signal flashed from the Shah and the
Amythist steamed toward the Huascar.
The Amythist was a wooden corvette,
equipped with twin screws. The Shah was
a commerce destroyer. Neither vessel was
a match for the modern ironclad Huascar.</p>
<p>Suddenly a shot came from the Shah.
The flag and pole at the stern of the Huascar
dropped overboard. The Huascar,
equipped with a revolving turret, sent a
shot at the Amythist, but it went wide of its
mark. The Amythist circled and sent a
broadside full on the Huascar, every shot
taking effect. With the aid of a glass I
could see the decks of the Amythist plainly
from my position on a huge rock. The
British sailors, stripped to the waist, cutlass
in hand, stood eagerly awaiting orders.
The gunners&rsquo; crews were engaged in firing
rapidly. The Huascar replied by slow but
heavy reports from her turret. The object
of the British was to disable the Huascar&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
turret, and they succeeded by directing all
shots against it.</p>
<p>The Huascar, finding she could not effect
the enemy by shots, turned to ram her.
The Amythist, being equipped with twin
screws, awaited the Huascar and when
within a short distance ran alongside and
poured her whole broadside on the rebel.
That was the last act before the Huascar
surrendered.</p>
<p>I was aboard the Huascar a few months
afterward at Mollendo and she presented a
most dilapidated appearance.</p>
<p>Thus again was General Pierola frustrated,
and by a British wooden vessel
against a crack ironclad of Peru. Pierola
escaped as usual, and the Huascar was
turned over to the Peruvian government.</p>
<p>A few days after the Amythist-Huascar
battle I discovered the people of Ilo were
cold and distant towards me, and I soon
learned the cause. Although they were in
favor of the existing government, they did
not relish the idea of their people being
beaten by the British. I could not condemn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
the acts of my own country and I felt it
would be better to leave Ilo, which I did,
little dreaming of the exciting events which
were soon to follow.</p>

<h2>X.</h2>
<h3>WE MEET AGAIN, FELICITA.</h3>
</div>
<p>The theater of Arequipa was ablaze with
lights. The youth and beauty had assembled
to follow the fortunes of the Count de
Monte Christo. I was seated in the dress
circle listening to the weird warlike strains
of Spanish music, when my eyes fell upon
the occupants of a box. A beautiful girl,
half hidden by the rich draperies, was talking
with an aristocratic looking old gentleman,
while by their side sat a young man,
dark-browed and sinister looking. I arose
and entered the box from the side door.
&ldquo;Don Julian Maldonado, I am delighted to
meet you,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am the boy you befriended
some years ago in the Cordilleras.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took my hand delightedly and bade
me be seated, offering me a chair between
himself and daughter. Don Julian whispered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
to me not to make myself known to
Felicita to see if she would recognize me.
All this was amusing to Don Julian, but
somewhat embarrassing to me, seated, as I
was, between them, and trying to carry on
a conversation with him. The expression
of wonderment in Felicita&rsquo;s beautiful eyes
was disconcerting to say the least. It was
evident she did not remember me. And yet
how could she be expected to. She was a
child of only nine years when we first met,
and who now, seven years later found me
unexpected and unannounced sitting beside
her in a theater.</p>
<p>Laughingly I turned to her and asked if
she did not recognize me, explaining that
the reason her father had not presented
me was that we had met seven years ago.</p>
<p>While I was speaking she was looking
earnestly at me, but when I recalled their
journey to La Paz she appeared dubious
and asked if I was the young lad she met
near Puno and if it was possible that I had
grown to manhood and learned to speak
Spanish? When I reassured her, the look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
of astonishment gave way to an exclamation
of joy.</p>
<p>The play was forgotten. We only talked
of our first meeting. She asked if I was
staying in Arequipa and on learning that
I was, promised that we should meet again,
as her father had decided to remain there
for some time. I was delighted but felt
somewhat disturbed because of the young
man in the box with her. When I began
to talk to Felicita he moved his seat farther
away. The Peruvians are the acme of
politeness.</p>
<p>The play being over, I assisted Felicita
with her wraps. Her father then introduced
me to Don Rodrigo Garcia, a fellow
traveller whom they had met on their journey
from Cusco to Arequipa.</p>
<p>I was not particularly well pleased with
the young man. First impressions sometimes
give rise to doubt and distrust. It
was so with me in this instance. Don
Julian insisted on my going home with
them. I walked with Felicita on one side
and Don Julian on the other, Don Rodrigo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
walking just ahead of me. Their home was
on Calle Mercaderes, one of the prettiest
squares of the city. Like most Peruvian
homes, the house was of adobe with flat
roof and partitions of plastered cane. It
contained six rooms. In the windows were
heavy iron bars, like all houses of the better
class. They were very serviceable, for
Spanish lovers do their courting between
the window bars. The girl sits beside the
window and her wooer stands in the street;
the parents sometimes invite him in.
Should he request the company of the girl
to the play or to any entertainment, the
invitation must include the whole family.
This custom in the larger cities is dying
out, but in the inland cities it is still adhered
to.</p>
<p>Arriving at the door, I bade Felicita and
her father good night with the assurance
that I would dine with them the next day.
Don Rodrigo also was invited. His hotel
was on my way and I accompanied him.
He was splendid company, and after reaching
his hotel I accepted his invitation to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
light lunch. Afterwards we enjoyed a cigar
and some rich old wine, but still I could
not overcome the aversion I first formed
for him.</p>
<p>The following day, long before the appointed
time for dinner, I was dressed and
ready. Chico, a half-breed Indian, whom I
had rendered a service one time when he
was being set upon by some of his own
people, and who afterwards slept in my
passage way, had my boots polished and
horse carefully groomed. He was a faithful
servant. He would find out where I
went and quietly follow, and after the manner
of his race, would lie down in some obscure
place in perfect contentment and
wait for me. I arrived at the home of Don
Julian at the appointed time, and found the
father and daughter awaiting me. A few
moments later, Don Rodrigo arrived and
we were seated in the parlor facing the
street. It was splendidly appointed. Although
the exterior of many Peruvian residences
appear shabby, the interior presents
a far different appearance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>I requested Felicita to play for us and
time passed quickly. Dinner being called I
took the liberty of escorting Felicita to the
table and was given the place beside her.
The Indian servants between courses, kept
our glasses filled. Felicita did not take
wine, and when dinner was over retired,
leaving us to enjoy our cigars and liquor.
We afterwards adjourned to the parlor,
where I gave my friends an account of my
life since our first meeting. I could see
that Don Rodrigo took every opportunity
to make light of my narrative.</p>
<p>I did not allude to being in Ilo during the
Amythist and Huascar affair, but after I
had given my friends a brief account of
myself, Don Rodrigo asked me my nationality.
I told him I was Scottish. He then
asked me what I thought of the Huascar
affair, hoping no doubt to belittle my
standing with Don Julian. I replied that I
had given it very little thought, and moreover
considered it a question for both governments
to settle, and was satisfied that
everything would be adjusted amicably.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>My reply seemed to annoy him, as he
doubtless thought I would commit myself,
and take the part of the British. He arose,
and pleading a press of business, begged
permission to retire. He shook hands with
Don Julian and daughter, but merely
bowed to me. I was glad he was gone.</p>
<p>Never before had I been so happy as
now, in Felicita&rsquo;s presence. For the first
time since leaving home this was the only
pleasure I had known. Felicita sang some
pretty Spanish ballads to the music of her
guitar and I went home that night with a
lightness of heart I had not experienced
for a long time.</p>
<p>My duties not requiring me to be away
from Arequipa often, much of my time was
spent with Felicita. Together we would
ride horseback over the picturesque valley,
with its olive and orange groves and along
shaded avenues of palms, with pebbly
brooks of crystal waters on either side. The
pure air and semi-tropical skies stimulated
our buoyant spirits, and made these the
halcyon days of my existence. My first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
dreams of love when we met in the Cordilleras
were now a blissful reality.</p>
<p>I saw little of Don Rodrigo in the weeks
that followed and was seldom in the company
of my comrades. Once a week I
would join them at the club, but aside from
that I was always to be found at Don Julian&rsquo;s
home.</p>
<p>Months sped by in sweet content as the
world took on a more roseate hue and the
future presented an alluring picture.</p>
<p>I met Don Rodrigo on the street one day
and as he nodded slightly I noticed an evil
look in his eyes. On returning to my room
late that night something glistened in the
moonlight on my door. I struck a match, a
blood red heart was traced on the panel,
and in the center stuck a dagger. What
did it mean?</p>

<h2>XI.</h2>
<h3>THE MASQUE BALL AT TIRAVAYA.</h3>
</div>
<p>It was the night of the annual masque
ball at Tiravaya, a summer resort a few
miles from Arequipa. The hall was
crowded with dancers; many gentlemen
were in Cavalier costume, with swords
clanking at their sides. Others were in
helmets, gorglet and breastplate, to represent
Pizarro&rsquo;s conquerors of Peru. Many
of the ladies wore quaint costumes and
rich attire of the court of Ferdinand and
Isabella, while a few were attired in
grotesque costumes. Felicita was dressed
as a princess of the court of the ancient
Incas, with a head dress of the rich plumage
of tropic birds. I was dressed in the
Highland garb of Scotland.</p>
<p>I soon discovered Felicita by the rosebud
in her hair. We took part in the grand
march and in nearly all the dances. The
soft strains of the music and the gayety
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
of the picturesque throng in the brilliantly
lighted room made the hours pass quickly
and it was soon time for unmasking. After
the general greeting was over, we proceeded
to the dining room where an elegant repast
was served. The supper being finished,
the music struck up again as the wine
was being served. Just then I observed
Rodrigo for the first time, and noticed that
he was intently watching me. I called Felicita&rsquo;s
attention to him and she seemed to
be frightened. She wanted to return home,
but I assured her there was no danger; we
were among friends. She replied that I
was not familiar with Spanish hatred, and
that he would sooner or later insult me. I
had known for more than three months,
that he had proposed to Felicita and been
refused. I also knew he was a gambler and
lived on his chances at the faro table. Being
an expert and without any sense of honor,
even to one of that profession, he was
seldom unsuccessful. I had never mentioned
to Don Julian or Felicita his manner
of life.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></div>
<p>An American, who unfortunately got under
the influence of wine, proposed a toast
to Peru, to which we all responded by raising
our glasses. Another toast was given
to the United States which received a similar
response. Toast followed toast in quick
succession. I merely raised my glass as I
had no desire to drink any more, and knowing
the long distance before me, I was on
the point of calling for Chico to have our
horses in readiness, when I heard my name
called and found that I was requested to
make a speech. I arose and congratulated
the company present for the pleasant time
we had passed, and the happy manner in
which everything had been conducted by
our host. All rose and gave him three
cheers.</p>
<p>Don Rodrigo then stepped to the center
between both tables, and asked everyone
present who denounced the British government
for its action in the Huascar affair,
to stand up. I knew the insult was meant
for me. I refused to stand, as also did
two of my British friends. After they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
seated Felicita again pleaded with me to
leave, but I could not do so with honor
then, and had I done so, I would have been
held in contempt afterwards. Don Rodrigo
came to where I was seated and addressing
himself to me said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I observe that you refuse to condemn
the action of the British government. Of
course you are a Britisher, but I must say
that the action of your government was
of the most cowardly nature, and anyone
who upholds such actions deserves the
name of coward; in fact, anyone who allows
himself to be ruled by the Queen of
Great Britain must be anything but a
brave man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cannot describe the thoughts that ran
through my brain. I stood like one paralyzed.
I could neither move nor speak, but
I was conscious that everyone was looking
at me and seemed to enjoy my discomfiture.
Felicita placed both hands on my
right arm and looked pleadingly in my face.
I could see everything quite plainly, but I
was bereft of all powers. Then by a valiant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
effort I recovered myself. Bending down,
I told Felicita to remain and not be
alarmed.</p>
<p>I arose and went to where Don Rodrigo
stood. I was calm and collected. &ldquo;Don
Rodrigo,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I came here by invitation,
and when I accepted had no thought
of being insulted. Neither do I believe
that our host or the gentlemen present intended
that I should be. You have without
provocation on my part, insulted my
Queen and called her subjects cowards.
The country that gave me birth never produced
cowards and I want to convince you
that I am not an exception.&rdquo; With this I
dealt him a terrific blow in the face.</p>
<p>He fell heavily to the floor and all was
confusion. Men leaped on tables and
chairs. Cries of &ldquo;Down with the foreigner!&rdquo;
were heard on every side. Then my
British friends came over to where I
stood, one of they saying, &ldquo;Good, Jack,
the coward deserved it! Let us stand side
by side and show them how the Queen&rsquo;s
subjects can defend themselves!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>I can see him now, his auburn hair disarranged
and partially hanging over his
forehead, his blue eyes sparkling with indignation,
his right hand holding a revolver.
The other said, &ldquo;There are only
three of us but we will show them how
Britishers can fight,&rdquo; at the same time
drawing his Colt&rsquo;s. I had also pulled my
gun, anticipating the worst, when the
American drew near and said: &ldquo;Jack, I
know nothing of your Queen or country; I
am an American, but you did right, and
what I would do under similar circumstances.
I will stand by you, although we
have little chance against such odds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Don Rodrigo had been assisted
to his feet, blood all over his face.
The uproar ceased for a few minutes, as
the crowd was without a leader. The blow
had told with effect&ndash;&ndash;two front teeth were
gone and both eyes were discolored, caused,
I think, by him coming in contact with the
floor. In a few moments cries of &ldquo;Down
with the foreigner,&rdquo; again commenced. We
knew it threatened our lives, but when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
looked down the barrels of four revolvers
they knew it also threatened some of their
lives.</p>
<p>Springing on a chair, I asked them to listen
to me. I told them that the quarrel they
had witnessed had been sought by Don
Rodrigo against me; and I asked why others
should suffer? Let him finish his quarrel
with me now or at any other time he
chose&ndash;&ndash;I would always meet him, and surely
gentlemen such as I knew them to be
would not so far forget themselves as to
endeavor to overcome us, who had never
done them harm?</p>
<p>This appeal was effective. Don Rodrigo
had been washed, and never did I see a face
with such devilish and malignant expression.
I was young and strong, with quite
a knowledge of the art of self defense, and
I watched him very closely lest he should
draw a knife.</p>
<p>Presently he said that he would be the
judge of time and place and manner of
meeting me, and that I would yet remember
Don Rodrigo Garcia. I did not answer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
and he walked out of the hall. I drank
several glasses of wine with those who, but
a few moments before, were crying for revenge.
I found Chico near me, and could
hardly refrain from laughing when I discovered
that he had armed himself before
leaving Arequipa with a great navy revolver
he found in my room. I am satisfied
had an attack been made on us, Chico would
have done his part, provided he had found
a way to use the revolver. I am satisfied he
never saw one before he came to Arequipa.</p>
<p>I told him to get the horses ready and
my friends remained near to prevent any
treachery. However, we were not molested
on the way home. Felicita begged me to
watch Don Rodrigo. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;that man&rsquo;s nature. He will watch you always,
and while he will not attack you
alone, he will pay others to inflict some injury
on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Julian was waiting and had hot
cocoa ready for us. We both concluded
that we would better tell him what had
happened lest he hear a wrong version
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
from others. They were determined that
I should spend the remainder of the night
in their house, but I concluded it would appear
cowardly. So, I bade them good
night and, with Chico following, perfectly
happy over the few dollars I had given
him, I reached home in safety.</p>
<p>I thought much about the affair at Tiravaya
and determined to watch Don Rodrigo
closely. A week later Don Julian informed
me he was going to Aacna on business. He
would be gone several days, but Felicita
would stay here. Fatal mistake.</p>

<h2>XII.</h2>
<h3>COWARDLY ACT OF A VILLAIN.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don Juan! Ah, Don Juan! Something
dreadful! Felicita!&rdquo; cried Chico as he
burst into my room breathless near midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I demanded, &ldquo;quick, I
say,&rdquo; but he could only gasp &ldquo;Felicita!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hurried to the stable and saddled my
horse, Chico following. We rode with all
haste to the home of Don Julian. Everything
was in uproar. The Indian servants
moaned and cried, and pointed in the direction
of the road leading to the cemetery.
Thither I rode, fast as my horse could run.
It was a lonely road, with few houses by
the wayside and those were mostly Indian
huts. It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, no one to be seen&ndash;&ndash;on and on I
went. I could see a dark outline of what I
thought must be a vehicle of some kind.
As carriages are seldom used in Arequipa,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
I concluded that this must be bearing Felicita
away. I drove the spurs harder and
leaned forward, peering into the darkness.
I was gaining rapidly. I was certain now
that it was Felicita, for they were driving
at full speed. I never thought how I was
to rescue her, my whole purpose being to
catch up with that villain. Just then the
moon shone bright from behind a cloud
and lighted up the scene. The occupants
of the carriage now knew they were being
pursued, and they stopped. I could plainly
see two men unhitch two horses from behind
the carriage. They took Felicita from
the carriage and were forcing her to mount
when, suddenly, her horse became unmanageable,
and she fell to the ground. By
this time I was close upon them, and called
to Felicita to be brave, but the poor girl
never heard me, for she was unconscious.
Don Rodrigo stopped, as if determined to
resist me. Would to God he had! But he
put spurs to his horse and fled. I shot at
him, but as the distance was great, and the
light uncertain, the bullet went wide of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
mark. I soon forgot him on reaching Felicita,
as she lay with an ugly cut on her head
caused by striking the carriage step when
she fell. There lay my child-friend, unconscious.
She was dressed for retiring, her
other clothes being in the carriage. My
first impulse was to pursue the accursed
scoundrel and avenge the insult to Felicita,
but I could not leave her there. I took her
in my arms and carried her to a near-by
Indian hut where, after some parley with
the poor, superstitious Indians, the door
was opened, and I laid my burden on some
sheepskins on the floor. Her hands were
cold and she appeared to be dead.</p>
<p>By this time, Chico arrived and brought
her clothes from the carriage. I staunched
the flow of blood with my handkerchief,
while Chico prepared some hot native liquor,
which I put to her lips. After a time,
she opened her eyes, but did not know me.
I called and called her name, but it was
long before consciousness returned. When
she did recognize me, a look of love and
happiness passed over her face. I would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
not let her speak, but told her that when
she was taken home, she could tell me all.
The carriage driver had long since made
his escape, so I had sent to Arequipa and
had a closed carriage brought, in which I
took her home.</p>
<p>Time dragged wearily until the return of
her father. I remained by her side and
with the assistance of the Indian servants,
made her as comfortable as possible. I
had been without sleep so long that I had
gone into the parlor and laid down. I had
just awakened from a sleep when Don Julian
entered. Poor old man, he was overcome
with grief. He knew all, Felicita had
told him. From him I learned how the abduction
had taken place. About 11 o&rsquo;clock
at night, Don Rodrigo had entered the bedroom
and before she realized what was being
done, Felicita had been carried to the
carriage in waiting. Leaving her in charge
of the driver, Don Rodrigo returned for
her clothes. No sooner was his back turned
than she screamed. This attracted the attention
of Chico, who had been enjoying a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
visit with Don Julian&rsquo;s Indian servants in
the kitchen. He had run at full speed to
inform me.</p>
<p>It was the opinion of Don Julian that
Don Rodrigo had intended taking the child
to some remote Indian habitation in the
mountains, and demanding a ransom for
her.</p>
<p>This was a plausible theory, for besides
getting revenge for Felicita refusing his
hand in marriage, he would be able to extort
money from Don Julian, and also
avenge his fancied wrongs at my hands.</p>
<p>The following day Felicita was still weak
and nervous. The doctor advised that she
be taken to the sea coast for a time. She
protested, saying she was getting stronger,
but I knew she was only saying it to cheer
her father and myself. I could plainly see
her condition was precarious. After a long
consultation with the doctors, Don Julian
decided he would take her to Truxillo, their
former home. After considerable pleading,
she consented to go. I was to follow
when she recovered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>I accompanied them and their Indian
servants aboard the steamer and remained
aboard the little ferry boat, waving my
handkerchief until they faded into the distance.
I returned ashore, and although
I had not been in Mollendo for some time,
I had no desire to see my friends. I
wanted to be alone.</p>
<p>Weeks of dreary waiting followed. I
was not myself. Anxiously I looked for a
letter and with trembling hands I broke the
seal. The letter was dated Lima, and read:
&ldquo;Don Juan, I am crazy. Felicita is dead.
Will write you all, when I am composed.
Julian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never was human being more distracted
than I. Absenting myself from everybody
night after night in deep ravines and valleys,
among the lofty mountains that surrounded
Arequipa, I wandered. Many an
Indian no doubt looked upon me with superstitious
awe, walking without caring
whither I went, like one demented. A second
letter came stating that the death of
Felicita was caused by a terrible cold she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
had contracted and the nervous shock suffered
on the night of the abduction. Like
his first, Don Julian&rsquo;s letter was brief. He
said: &ldquo;I will let you know where she is
buried in my next, and I think I will not
be long after her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I concluded to go to Lima, but another
letter, dated Truxillo, stated that he had
left Lima and would bury Felicita in Truxillo.
I received no more missives. To go
to Lima was useless, to go to Truxillo and
perhaps not find him there, would not accomplish
anything so I decided to wait until
I heard further news. I scarcely know
how I passed my time. Night after night
I would go up town, play billiards and visit
the drinking places, always with the
hope that I would meet Don Rodrigo.</p>
<p>I intended, when I heard from Don Julian
to make a trip to Truxillo, visit the
last resting place of Felicita, and perhaps
remain in Lima, away from scenes that
reminded me of the only happy time in my
existence, and its tragic ending. But circumstances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
over which I had no control
changed my plans.</p>
<p>One night, as I was sitting alone in my
room, a boy handed me a telegram. It
was from the general manager of the railroad,
saying to report at his office at once
and bring all the engine runners with me,
and to enjoin absolute secrecy on the part
of the men. I did as requested, and now
begins one of the most exciting adventures
of my life.</p>

<a name='XIII_MURDEROUS_PLAN_OF_THE_INSURGENTS' id='XIII_MURDEROUS_PLAN_OF_THE_INSURGENTS'></a>
<h2>XIII.</h2>
<h3>MURDEROUS PLAN OF THE INSURGENTS.</h3>
</div>
<p>On my arrival at the manager&rsquo;s office,
I found him in consultation with the Prefecto
of Arequipa and the General in command
of the regular army. I was informed
that another revolution was about to
be attempted in Peru in favor of General
Pierola.</p>
<p>The General said he had a valuable package
which must be delivered to the Prefecto
of Puno, that in the event the package
was captured it would ruin all their
plans. Would I undertake to deliver it for
the government? I turned to the general
manager and, speaking to him in English,
said: &ldquo;There is some mystery connected
with this. Before I pledge myself to do
this, it will be necessary to have a clear
understanding.&rdquo; He repeated my request
to the General, who informed me that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
secret message had come over the wires
that a revolution had broken out again,
and this time the insurgents had taken
possession of several points to prevent the
government troops from reaching Puno;
that the package I was to take was a notice
to the Prefecto of Puno, for himself and
those in favor of the government, to proceed
to a designated place, where the government
troops would arrive, and march
by stages to Puno.</p>
<p>I realized the danger connected with
this undertaking and accepted the responsibility
with some trepidation. A generous
reward awaited me if I succeeded, but
it was understood in accepting the perilous
message, no instructions were to be given
me; that I was to use my own judgment
and, if danger threatened the package, to
destroy it before it should be captured.</p>
<p>The little Arequipena had long since
been rebuilt, and I at once proceeded to
put her in readiness for the journey. Manuel,
my fireman, was a native of Arequipa,
a powerfully built and sturdy fellow. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
had been much among the British and
American railway men and could understand
English.</p>
<p>After leaving orders as to the time of
starting, I called on an English friend and
confided my mission. I asked him, in event
of my death, to write to my relatives in
Scotland, giving the details. He did everything
in his power to dissuade me, but I
told him his talk was idle. No use, I had
made up my mind. Upon seeing the Arequipena
ready, the men in the shops questioned
me, but I evaded their questions.</p>
<p>I went to the office of the general manager
and he gave me the package, unaddressed,
done up securely, and sealed with
red wax. I placed it in the inside pocket
of my vest. The manager asked me to be
careful with myself. He would much rather
I should not go, but in my state of mind,
I was only too glad to get my thoughts off
the sad remembrance of Felicita&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>I left Arequipa at ten o&rsquo;clock that night,
cautiously and silently leaving the station.
I arrived at Puno the following evening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
and lay over at Juliaca Junction a few
hours. At this point the station master
asked me where I was going. I replied
that I had orders for Puno. Leaving Juliaca,
I arrived at Puno at exactly five
o&rsquo;clock. I blew the whistle for the station.
I noticed that it was crowded with people,
but saw no one I would suspect of being a
revolutionist. I put the engine in the shed,
and then went and washed up. I hid the
package in a secure place, where it was impossible
for anyone to find it, as I had
planned to go to the hotel, eat supper and
then learn my chances for getting to the
Prefecto, before I took the package from
its hiding place. The station of Puno,
like all terminal stations of the Arequipa
railway, was fenced in by corrugated iron,
about eight feet high, and it was necessary
to go through the station outlet, which was
only opened on the arrival and departure
of trains, or another outlet guarded by a
dog and night watchman. I went out by
the small gate, familiarly bidding the
watchman good evening. This gate only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
employes had the right to use. I walked
up town to the hotel Inca. I met several
gentlemen who knew me and asked one to
play a game of billiards before supper. No
one seemed to think that my coming was
anything more than the usual routine of
railway business.</p>
<p>After darkness, I lit a cigar and strolled
down the street where the Prefecto lived.
I observed the sentry at the front entrance
and upon close observation, I found that
the rear of the house could be approached
by a little back street connecting with a
small alleyway by means of which the
house could be entered from the front.</p>
<p>I retraced my steps to the station but
did not go near the gate. I went around to
the engine shed, where an opening had been
made by the boys so they could get to their
rooms when out late nights and avoid
answering the questions of the watchman.
When I reached the Arequipena, the wipers
were cleaning her. I spoke to the foreman,
and getting the package, went out the same
way, no one noticing my departure. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
going through, the narrow street I went up
the small alley and, seeing no one, presented
myself at the main entrance of the Prefecto&rsquo;s
house. Here the sentry barred my
passage and demanded the password. I
told him to call the officer of the guard, and
when he appeared I explained that I had
important business with Senor Prefecto,
and desired to see him personally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Senor Prefecto will answer that
question,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>I had folded the package and hid it in the
lining of my overcoat which I had thrown
over my arm. The officer withdrew for a
few minutes, but soon returned and allowed
me to pass the sentry. Halting in
front of a large door, a signal was given
and it was opened by another officer. I
was ushered in, and from there into an adjoining
room, where I was told to wait.</p>
<p>Presently there came in a priest, then an
officer with side arms, and last Senor Prefecto,
who asked me the nature of my business.
I replied that I had a message for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
the Prefecto, which could be imparted to
him alone. When my errand was communicated
to him, he could do as he chose.</p>
<p>There was much hesitation before my request
for a private audience was granted,
but on being searched, overcoat and all, the
Senor Prefecto finally agreed to see me
alone. When the others had retired, I took
the package from the lining of my overcoat
and gave it to him.</p>
<p>I watched him closely as he read the contents.
His face became blanched, and his
hands shook in abject fear, although nothing
else could have been expected from
him, as he was an arrant coward.</p>
<p>After reading the document, he called
the others. He handed it to the priest, who
asked where I came from. I told him.
Then he wanted to know if anyone had
seen me enter here, and whether the arrival
of the Arequipena was known. I told
him I thought no one would pay any attention
to the arrival of the train but would
consider it the ordinary routine railway
business. A consultation was held, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
after they found that I knew the contents
of the message I had brought, they admitted
me to their council. They asked me to
get the Arequipena ready, and they and
the principal officers would flee to Arequipa.
I told them that such a course
could not be pursued, as all the telegraph
offices were in the hands of the insurgents,
and that our departure would become
known, the engine surrounded and all taken
prisoners. They agreed it would be impossible
to escape that way, and decided
that about midnight they would escape on
horseback. Just then an officer arrived and
reported that the insurgents had taken
possession of the station, and two engines,
one being the regular passenger. One of
the engine runners had been taken prisoner.
Their spy had reported that it was
their intention to take both engines and
several coaches loaded with soldiers and
arms; also, large quantities of powder had
been put on the Arequipena for the purpose
of destroying Sumbay bridge&ndash;&ndash;to prevent
the passage of government troops.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>I was forgotten for the time being, their
fear for their own safety outweighing all
other considerations. Another officer came
in and breathlessly added the climax. The
regiment of regulars had joined the insurgents!</p>
<p>I was now doing some rapid thinking. If
Sumbay bridge was destroyed and the fact
not known in Arequipa, the government
troops would come along and, with the engine
crew, be hurled into eternity. The
bridge being about one hundred and seventy-five
feet high and six hundred feet
long and on a curve with deep cuts on
either side and a heavy down grade, it
would be impossible for any train to stop,
unless warned beforehand.</p>
<p>This was the murderous scheme of the
insurgents.</p>
<p>I learned it was the intention of the insurgents
to proceed to Vincocaya in the
morning, destroy as they went along, the
telegraph offices, wait at Vincocaya until
the arrival of the regular passenger train
from Arequipa and then proceed to Sumbay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
bridge. They evidently had calculated
with a great deal of precision, and if their
plans carried, victory would certainly be
theirs.</p>
<p>All these things were filling me with apprehension.
I knew I would be captured,
but how could I save the bridge? I was
determined to try at all hazards.</p>

<h2>XIV.</h2>
<h3>FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY.</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;This document calls for the payment of
$10,000, and guarantees you life employment
by the government of Peru, provided
you save the Sumbay bridge,&rdquo; said the
prefecto as he handed me a paper duly
witnessed by the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Senor, I cannot accept it,&rdquo; I replied.
&ldquo;I will do my duty for the sake of
humanity. It is part of my plan to be captured
by the insurgents and should that
paper be found on my person, I would be
shot as a spy. If I succeed you can reward
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I left the Prefecto and his party, wishing
them a safe journey, and sauntered
carelessly back to the Inca hotel. I entered
smoking a cigar and wearing a look of unconcern,
pretended I was not aware of any
revolutionary movement. There were several
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
men playing billiards in the parlors.
I took a chair and sat down to watch the
players. About 11 o&rsquo;clock I asked to be
shown to my room, and retired, knowing
full well that I had been watched by a
citizen of Puno since my entrance to the
hotel, and I was satisfied I would soon be
taken prisoner.</p>
<p>About 2 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I was
awakened from a restless sleep by the
entrance of twelve men armed with bare
swords and revolvers. They were all talking
at once. I sat up in bed and appeared
to be amazed. The leader requested me to
dress and accompany him. The streets
were lined with people shouting the old familiar
cry, &ldquo;Viva Pierola,&rdquo; as I was
marched in the center of this crowd. The
cry resounded down street after street. The
city was wild with excitement. The escape
of the Prefecto was on every lip, as we
turned at a street corner and to the station.
We had great difficulty in obtaining
entrance, but a passage was cleared and I
was ushered into the presence of the leader
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
of the revolutionary forces. He was about
fifty years of age, some six feet in heighth,
and powerfully built, but with a countenance
far from pleasing.</p>
<p>With little ceremony, I was notified to
get the Arequipena ready to depart from
the station at 7 o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The
principal officers would go with her, I was
told, and the regular train would follow
with the troops.</p>
<p>I replied that as a British subject it
would be impossible for me to comply, unless
force was used; that I protested
against this high-handed proceeding. I did
this so that, in the future, no one could
accuse me of aiding the rebels willingly.
He replied that he did not care for the British
government, that I would do as I was
told or suffer the consequences. They
then escorted me to the engine house,
where I found my fireman Manuel already
a prisoner; also Beaumont, the other
engineer, and his fireman.</p>
<p>After getting the engine ready, I requested
the officer in charge to allow us to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
procure something to eat. His permission
was given, then another procession
marched through the streets to the hotel,
where the rebel guards stood over us at
breakfast.</p>
<p>The Arequipena was ready. Behind
were the passenger engine and five
coaches, which rebel troops were already
entering. At breakfast I had managed to
get a few words with Beaumont.</p>
<p>As the Arequipena was to go ahead, I
would endeavor to get the officers out to
eat at Vincocaya. I would give a signal
for him to uncouple his engine and follow
at full speed. It would be impossible to
stop him and they would be at the mercy of
the government troops, which would leave
that afternoon, according to the instructions
given the Prefecto of Puno from Arequipa.</p>
<p>The officers came aboard the little Arequipena
and loaded on several barrels of
powder, picks and shovels to destroy the
abutments of the bridge.</p>
<p>There were eleven officers who came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
aboard the coach, when to my surprise, I
beheld along with three soldiers, Don Rodrigo
Garcia, who was to guard me. I cannot
describe my feelings. I know I am not
a coward, but I was taken with a shock of
nervousness. It was not of long duration.
Indignation took the place of fear, but I
realized how formidable a task I had undertaken
to save Sumbay bridge. Howbeit,
I determined more than ever to succeed,
and the knowledge of that man being near
me, gave me renewed courage.</p>
<p>Before starting he hissed to me: &ldquo;Don
Juan, we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not answer. It was all I could do
to keep from attacking him despite the disadvantage
I was at. The thought of the
bridge, however, restrained any hasty action.</p>
<p>We left the station with the troop train
closely following. According to orders, our
first stop would be at Juliaca station. I
knew that when we reached there the telegraph
office would be destroyed. Telegraph
communication was cut off between Juliaca
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
station and Puno. Nearing the station, we
stopped to take water from a tank. I asked
permission from the leader to allow my
fireman to go and draw some oil, explaining
that I had none and it was necessary,
that his going there would not create suspicion,
and it would save much time. I
was greatly surprised when he consented.
I took a small piece of paper and wrote the
following in English: &ldquo;Van Buren, I am
coming with rebels to destroy Sumbay
bridge. Hurry up troops. Buchan.&rdquo; After
writing, I read aloud in Spanish: &ldquo;Procure
from Senor Southers, the station master,
two quarts of engine oil for the Arequipena.&rdquo;
I handed it to Manuel who understood
my meaning. He took the engine
cans and walked to the office.</p>
<p>My heart beat rapidly. I fairly held my
breath. Would he be able to see Southers
before I took water? Would Southers understand
my meaning and get the message
off before we arrived at the platform and
find the office destroyed? I delayed taking
water as long as possible, then pulled slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
down the track to the platform. The
moment we stopped, the officers rushed in
the telegraph office and disconnected the
instruments from the wires. Don Rodrigo
and his three soldiers never left me for a
moment, which made me suspect that my
every movement would be closely watched.</p>
<p>The fireman came down the platform,
both engine oil cans in his hands. I asked
him if he had seen Southers. He replied
that he had and that everything was all
right. I received the oil and looked at him.
His look told plainly that the message was
sent. I felt that a heavy load had been
lifted and breathed freer. I looked at Don
Rodrigo. I was satisfied that in a short
time we would meet in a struggle that
would be the final one between us.</p>
<p>After the office had been destroyed we
started again, the troop train always close
behind us. We stopped at Cabanillas, Maravillas
and Santa Lucia and carried away
their telegraph instruments; then we ran
direct to Vincocaya. Arriving there the
telegraph office suffered like the others. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
pulled down in front of the hotel, then told
the officers that the passenger train was
due in an hour, and that it would be impossible
to proceed until its arrival. I
showed him the time card to satisfy him I
was telling the truth, and remarked that
advantage might be taken of the time by
having supper. Accordingly all of them,
left the Arequipena except Don Rodrigo
and the three soldiers. The officers left
their arms in the little coach. Now was the
time to act. Should I fail now, no other
chance would present itself, for, after the
arrival of the passenger train, the only
stop would be at Sumbay bridge, when it
would be too late. I figured that, after
Van Buren had received my message from
Juliaca the troops could not possibly arrive
at Sumbay bridge before eight o&rsquo;clock that
night. It was four o&rsquo;clock when we reached
Vincocaya and the passenger would be
leaving Sumbay station. Pucacancha was
another station between Sumbay and Vincocaya.
The grade being 160 feet to the
mile, the train makes very slow time between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
Sumbay and Pucacancha. It was my
only hope to succeed in getting to Pucacancha
before the arrival of the passenger
train.</p>
<p>I was nervous. I got off the engine, then
called to Manuel to hand me another oil
can. I spoke to him in English to have
everything ready. I was going to run
away with the engine&ndash;&ndash;would he assist me?
This I asked while I was pretending to oil
the engine, and I had to trust largely to
Manuel&rsquo;s intuition, as he knew but little
English. He returned to the engine and
raised a full head of steam. I noticed Don
Rodrigo watching me from one of the side
doors of the coach. I climbed back on the
engine and put away the oil can, when Rodrigo
said with a significant tone: &ldquo;My
time will soon come when I can avenge the
insult I received at Tiravaya.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not answer. I knew his meaning.
When my services were no longer required,
he would, with his cowardly instinct, devise
a means to kill me. The three soldiers
were a fair sample of the poor ignorant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Peruvians. They were armed with
breech-loading rifles of French pattern,
bayonets fixed. After Rodrigo had muttered
his threat, he went into the little
coach, sitting directly behind me, and
could, by his position, observe every move
I made. Manuel was standing on the left
watching me. Although I had endeavored
to make him understand, he was not aware
of my plans. I looked back and saw the
troop train taking water at the tank. I
looked at Manuel, and he understood &ldquo;the
time had come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With my left hand, I threw the throttle
wide open and with my right blew the signal
agreed upon. With a prayer to God I
threw myself upon the nearest soldier.</p>

<h2>XV.</h2>
<h3>IN DESPERATE STRUGGLE FOR LIFE.</h3>
</div>
<p>Don Rodrigo and his soldiers were surprised.
I dealt the one nearest me a terrific
blow in the face. Don Rodrigo raised
his hand to fire. I knocked his gun from
his hand. The other soldier thrust at me
with his bayonet, inflicting a severe scalp
wound, which along with another thrust at
me with his bayonet in my left arm, gave
him time to recover. I struck the soldier in
the face, and knocked him to the floor. The
other was coming at me, when Manuel,
armed with a shovel, brought it down with
terrific force on his head.</p>
<p>By this time the engine was going at
lightning speed, having reached a down
grade of 160 feet to the mile. The throttle
was wide open. I knew we would soon
reach some sharp curves and if the speed
was not checked, the engine would jump
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the track. I called to Manuel to shut off
the steam, and apply the brakes. At this
time I was struggling with Don Rodrigo
for life or death. We had clinched one another.
I spoke once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recuerdo Felicita,&rdquo; I hissed in his ear.</p>
<p>He did not speak. He was never a physical
match for me, but at this moment he
seemed endowed with superhuman
strength. His face took on the awful look
of desperation, that comes to men when
death seems near at hand. His lithe body
struggled to be free of my grasp. He tried
to trip me and just then the engine rounded
a sharp curve causing him to stagger. The
side door of the coach was open. For a
moment he vainly tried to catch hold of
something, and then, with a shriek upon his
lips, fell from the speeding coach.</p>
<p>The struggle had lasted but a short time,
but it had seemed to me hours. Manuel bandaged
my head and arm. The two soldiers
remained perfectly passive, suffering from
severe blows. The one felled by Manuel
was still unconscious.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>We were within three miles of Pucacancha,
rounding a sharp curve, when I looked
back and exclaimed: &ldquo;My God, Manuel,
the troop train is coming!&rdquo; My blood almost
froze, but realizing that this was no
time for fright, I determined to master the
situation.</p>
<p>I knew the two soldiers would not attempt
to molest us. They had learned a
lesson. I looked at my watch. In five minutes
the passenger, if on time, would be at
Pucacancha. The troop train could not
reach there for fifteen minutes, because at
all obscure places it would have to go slow
for fear of meeting obstructions on the
track.</p>
<p>I reached Pucacancha, stopping far
enough back to allow the passenger to pull
up and back on the side track. The siding
had only one switch, chiefly used for ballast
for the road bed. I looked anxiously
for the passenger. Seconds dragged like
hours. Would she never come? There was
a curve not far from the station, and the
passenger could not be seen until it almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
reached it. I listened. I could hear the
low tremulous noise of the rails, a puff of
black smoke went up from behind the
curve&ndash;&ndash;at last it was in view, engine No. 8.
On seeing me the engineer came to a sudden
stop. I hurriedly told him what to do.
He was to back onto the siding and let me
pass, then pull out and follow me back to
Pampa de Avieras, where I told him the
government troops would surely be. Our
plans were quickly executed. I determined
that should the troop train come before I
could get by the passenger, Manuel and I
would desert the Arequipena, start her
back with a full head of steam, and cause a
collision. No doubt there would have been
loss of life, but it would have given an opportunity
to escape by going on the passenger
train.</p>
<p>Dobbie, the engineer, succeeded well in
backing into the clear. Not seeing the
troop train, I ran with a hammer and spike
when he left the switch with the Arequipena
ahead of him and spiked the track.
Just then the troop train came in sight. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
hurriedly boarded the Arequipena and
started, Dobbie backing up at fast as he
could.</p>
<p>There were several officers on the engine
of the troop train, and when they saw us
they compelled the engineer to increase
his speed, with the result he could not
check his train in time to stop it from running
into the switch. His engine jumped
the track half burying itself in the ground.</p>
<p>We arrived at Pampa de Avieras and the
government troops came thirty minutes
later. I was beginning to get weak from
loss of blood. My left arm seemed to be a
dead weight, and the muscles were painful
and swollen. The people from the passenger
train crowded about me and did everything
in their power to relieve my suffering.
The soldier who had been struck with
the shovel came out of his stupor.</p>
<p>I was lying in the coach of the Arequipena,
when the commanding officer of the
government troops came to see me. After
detailing the story to him, I turned over
fourteen rifles, ten revolvers, and seven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
swords, all the cartridges and barrels of
powder, together with the three soldiers
whom I pleaded for, stating that compulsion
was the cause of their joining the insurgents.
I insisted on their hurrying to
Sumbay bridge, although I told him they
did not have anything now with which to
destroy the bridge. However, they could
post their troops should they arrive first
and be in position to command the approaches.
After leaving me, he ordered
his troops forward.</p>
<p>I was getting weaker and weaker. At
last orders came to go to Arequipa with the
Arequipena. The station master telegraphed
to have a doctor ready for me on
my arrival. It was nearly forty miles from
Pampa de Avieras to Arequipa, mostly
down grade. I had to give the engine up
to Manuel, as the pain in my arm became
so intense I had to lie down. The station
at Arequipa was crowded back to the
street, the news having been telegraphed
by the officer in command of the government
troops. I could hear cries of &ldquo;Viva
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Juancita!&rdquo; that being my name in Spanish.</p>
<p>The people in Arequipa were loyal to the
existing government. The general manager
met me with the doctor. His eyes were
full of tears when he saw me. I presented
a horrible and bloody appearance, the
wound in my head still bleeding, my left
arm in a sling and my clothes almost in
rags.</p>
<p>I was carried from the coach by four of
my friends to my room where the faithful
Chico had everything prepared. Cries of
&ldquo;Viva Juancita!&rdquo; rent the air from the
time I left the coach until the doctor requested
silence. Manuel was taken home
by his friends. The poor people, ignorant
of the revolution, but knowing by the demonstration
that something unusual had
happened, realized that he had done something
deserving recognition.</p>
<p>My friends grouped about with tear-dimmed
eyes, and warmly pressed my
hand. Chico, looking at me with a most
sympathetic expression on his Indian features,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
did not restrain his tears. For days
I tossed in pain and delirium.</p>
<p>One day when the general manager
came, he told me that another engineer who
had taken out the Arequipena to repair the
telegraph, came up with a body of the insurgents
who were going to surrender, but
they intended to kill him first thinking he
was I. Only the timely interposition of
one who knew him, saved his life. The insurgents
had got their engine back on the
track after much time and labor, but it
was damaged and as they were out of
water, they gave up hope of winning their
cause.</p>
<p>The train bearing the government troops
stopped when within a few miles of Vincocaya,
where they picked up the body of Don
Rodrigo Garcia and buried it near the
track. He would have exulted over my
death, but I cannot say that I felt any satisfaction
because he was dead. It only
brought sad memories of the past.</p>

<h2>XVI.</h2>
<h3>THE SCREAMING WINDS OF NIGHT.</h3>
</div>
<p>I sat on the broad balcony of the British
consulate at Mollendo, looking out over the
blue waters of the Pacific. The soft breeze
from the south seas imparted the glow of
health. How proud I felt with the knowledge
that no one dared insult me beneath
the blue and crimson folds that waved
above. Safe from the assassin&rsquo;s knife at
the hands of some of Pierola&rsquo;s men, of
whom I had been warned, I felt a certain
refuge beneath the ensign of my country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don Juan, does that make me a Britisher,
too?&rdquo; asked Manuel, pointing to the
flag above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it protects you too. Pierola&rsquo;s
men do not dare to harm us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Praised be the Virgin,&rdquo; replied Manuel,
crossing himself.</p>
<p>The great bells of the cathedral tolled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
out a funeral knell as a solemn procession
marched to a transport ship. They were
dust covered, haggard men, with a hunted
look, chained in pairs. On either side
marched a file of soldiers with fixed bayonets.
Pierola&rsquo;s men were being taken to
Lima.</p>
<p>I arose from the balcony and went inside.
They had to pass under the balcony
of the British consulate to reach the wharf.
I did not care to witness their misery and
so remained indoors until their departure.
The revolution over, there was nothing now
to fear; Manuel packed my belongings and
we returned to Arequipa.</p>
<p>The general manager requested me to
take care of the shops of Vincocaya. It
would enable me to be quiet and recover
from my wounds, as there was nothing to
do but to see that the work was kept going.
Meanwhile the excitement of the revolution
would die out.</p>
<p>Vincocaya is situated high in the Andes,
above timber line, a desolate and dreary
waste of rock and crag, where wild winds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
scream among the cliffs in the blackness of
the night, as though a thousand imprisoned
Joshuas were reaching upward for that
sun which will stand still no more over the
plains of Ajalon. Leaden clouds drift like
winding sheets among the peaks and hover
like a pall over ca&ntilde;on and deep ravine.
The grave of Don Rodrigo was but a few
miles distant, but I never visited it. There
have been times when I regretted not
stretching forth my hand to save him, but
at the time, with a most violent hatred of
the man and the many injuries I had received
from him, and the attempt to save
the bridge foremost in my mind, I found
excuse for lack of the finer feelings. And,
too, what would it benefit had he been
saved? His life was spent in debauchery,
the gambling table and plots to overthrow
any government where a leader in opposition
to the ruling power would promise him
a political office.</p>
<p>Deep down in my heart I felt the weight
of the past; those shrieking winds of the
night were the responsive echoes of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
soul for the loved and lost. Was it upon
this planet or upon some distant sphere
that we two had met and loved and builded
hopes as high as the lofty peaks that now
entombed me&ndash;&ndash;hope and love that may
have been breathed in the morning of the
world when the spirit of God dwelt within
us&ndash;&ndash;hope that existed before the wrathful
change that shattered all and turned an
Eden into blackness and despair?</p>
<p>Days, weeks and months passed. Often
I would spend hours in the wild solitudes
hunting the vicuna and alpaca, or in some
gloomy ca&ntilde;on communing with myself.
Within my spirit I could hear an undertone,
&ldquo;Why cast thyself on waters wild,
believing that God is gone, that love is
dead and Nature spurns her child?&rdquo; So,
from my grief, I arose at length to feel new
life returning. New hopes and ambitions
sprang forth in my soul that had so keenly
felt God&rsquo;s chastening rod.</p>
<p>A year had passed. I was in Arequipa.
Chico had my room ready and my friends
gave me a splendid banquet in one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
largest restaurants in the city. In all ages
the world has had two ways of doing honor
to a man. One is by parade, the other by
setting him down to a banquet table and
making speeches about him until they overcrowd
his emotions and leave him limp and
speechless. I had to pass through this ordeal.
The Prefectos of Arequipa and
Puno, the Commanding General of the Government
troops, the manager and officials
of the railway and a host of friends of lesser
note, but none the less loyal hearts,
crowded the banquet room. They feasted,
drank wine, sang songs and made speeches
to me and about me that were enough to
have satisfied the vanity of a survivor of
Thermopylae. At the close, the Prefecto
of Puno arose, and after saying things that
were loudly applauded, presented me with
ten thousand dollars not as a gift, but as
something I had justly earned. He was
followed by the general manager of the
railroad, who said his company desired to
show their appreciation of my conduct in
the Sumbay bridge affair, and on their behalf
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
he presented me with two thousand
dollars. Manuel, too, came in for his share
of honors and praise. He was presented
with five hundred dollars by the Prefecto
of Puno and two hundred dollars by the
company&ndash;&ndash;more money than he had ever
seen in his life, or ever hoped to possess.
Deserving fellow, his eyes streamed with
tears of joy and gratitude when he received
the money which would now enable
him to own a comfortable home. His pleasure
was even greater the next day, when I
gave him one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>A month later, and Arequipa was wild
with excitement. War had been declared
by Chile against allied Peru and Bolivia.
It was a sad blow, as Peru had been extremely
prosperous and was rapidly forging
ahead in the commerce of the world. I
had concluded to leave the country and
seek some other field, when a call was
made to the railroad men to assist the government
to convey troops from the interior
to the coast. I responded and was sent to
Santa Rosa on the proposed railway to
Cusco, the ancient capital of Peru. Here
a great number of Indians were huddled
together to be sent to Arequipa, and drilled
and sent to the coast. They were abject
and disconsolate. The priests were calling
on them to be brave and return victorious.
These people had never seen the ocean and
had never lived in an altitude of less than
two miles. There was much suffering in
store for them under the tropic sun of the
coast. I asked an officer if he thought
these men would make good soldiers. He
replied with an air of great importance,
and looking quite serious, that he had received
word that the Chilean navy was
coming to bombard Mollendo, and it was
his intention to instruct the Indians in the
use of the rifle. When the ships came near
enough, he would station his men among
the rocks and shoot the sailors off the
decks. This, too, with flint lock rifles&ndash;&ndash;a
sample of the calibre of the Peruvian officer
of the interior and his unfortunate Indian
soldiers.</p>
<p>After getting to the head of the Tambo
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
valley, I proceeded to Mollendo and found
a terrible state of affairs. Everyone was
expecting the Chilean fleet; men and women
were carrying their household goods
to the mountains. At sight of every ship
on the horizon, whether sailing vessel or
steamer, a cry would go forth&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;They
come&ndash;&ndash;they come!&rdquo; The greatest confusion
prevailed. There was no organization,
no discipline; everybody for himself,
and all running at the cry of&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;They
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One morning about ten o&rsquo;clock the hostile
fleet did come.</p>

<h2>XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE BARBARIAN MEETS HIS INGOMAR.</h3>
</div>
<p>A heavy fog was clearing from the sea,
when from out of the mist rose the black
hull and conning tower of the Cochrane.
The senior officers of the flagship stood
grouped on the starboard rail. The wind
changed suddenly to the west, and, as it
changed, it rolled up patches of the fog and
revealed the black hull and conning tower
of the Enlado. A heavy cloud of smoke
poured from their funnels; decks cleared
for action when they should put into practice
the desperate objects of their existence.</p>
<p>A boat was lowered from the flagship
and rowed to the wharf of Mollendo by
sturdy Chileans, while an officer bore a
message to the Prefecto for all noncombatants
to leave the city, as bombardment
would begin in an hour.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>As the boat was leaving, it was fired
upon. Then the ear-splitting reports which
followed showed how the flagship took this
breach of the rules of war. There was the
rushing swishing sound, the terrifying
screech of projectiles passing through the
air, followed by terrific explosions and the
crash of falling buildings.</p>
<p>In the city, pandemonium reigned. Men
and women with blanched faces, were fleeing
to the hills. Others threw themselves
upon the ground, too terror-stricken to
move. I heard a voice at my elbow calling
in English. It was the voice of a woman,
young and fair. &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; said I, and
we hurried toward the massive rock from
whose summit I had watched the battle of
the Huascar and Amythist two years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe now,&rdquo; I said, as we stood
behind the thousands of tons of granite,
&ldquo;safe as if we were behind the rock of Gibraltar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, sister and Mr. Robinson&ndash;&ndash;heaven
help them at this hour!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
A shell struck a stone building
and exploded by impact; fragments
screamed like a panther in the air.</p>
<p>The young woman&rsquo;s face was blanched
to a death-like pallor, but she was calm,
and, kneeling by my side, she asked God to
help us. Aloud she prayed, a beautiful,
impressive prayer, one that must have
gone straight to the throne of heaven and
received its answer, for soon the wind
shifted and those belching volcanoes of the
sea were curtained by the fog; the firing
ceased.</p>
<p>We hurried to her home amid scenes of
desolation and confusion. Her family was
safe and, to my surprise, the Mr. Robinson
she had spoken of was an employe of our
railway, who had but lately arrived from
the United States and to whom I had been
introduced a few days before.</p>
<p>The bombardment was now over, but the
human wolves began to sack the city. Fire
was raging in some quarters and burned
far into the night. It lit the streets with a
lurid glare; its red light fell upon motionless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
figures in the dust, and scurrying
forms, bent beneath their weight of
plunder.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson was anxious to send his
family to Arequipa, and I lent them all possible
assistance, receiving their heartfelt
thanks. They were in a strange land, not
even knowing the language of the country.
Hattie, the young woman I had met, was
the sister-in-law of Mr. Robinson. Mrs.
Robinson and her mother, an aged woman,
were disappointed with Peru and were
glad to get away from the theatre of war.</p>
<p>I met the Indian soldiers the next day,
and the officer commanding was very indignant
at his superior for not allowing
him to go to the rocks at Mollendo and
pick off the gunners from the battle ships,
with flint lock rifles.</p>
<p>I was a frequent visitor at the home of
the Robinson family in Arequipa, with
whom I had now become well acquainted. It
was strange to my ears to hear them all
talk English, for seldom had I heard my
own language spoken by women. The old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
lady was one of those quiet, sweet, motherly
women. Once introduced to her, it
seemed one had always known her. The
whole family was the happiest and most
cheerful I had ever met. Hattie Judson
became school teacher to the English and
American children in Arequipa, and her
gentle ways soon won the hearts of all. I
enjoyed taking her to the theatre and other
places of amusement, because of her bright
conversation and high ideals. From her
I began to catch a glimpse of the nobler
things of life, things that to me, being but
poorly educated and in a foreign land, had
been denied. She was a sweet singer and
an excellent performer on the piano, and
somehow when she sang I was able to understand
the soul-reaching depths of the
melody.</p>
<p>There was company at the house one
night, when I heard her sing for the first
time &ldquo;Coming Thro&rsquo; the Rye.&rdquo; My soul
floated back to Bonnie Scotland, as when a
boy I saw the waving fields of grain, the
cows in the barnyard, and the lassies coming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
down the path from school; my mother
with the willow basket, bringing in the
clothes from the line, and father smoking
his pipe by the well&ndash;&ndash;scenes that nevermore
would return.</p>
<p>In our walks in the shaded dells of the
mountains, she often told me of the United
States, the habits and customs of the people&ndash;&ndash;how
ambitions and aspirations were
rewarded when accompanied by virtue and
industry. Of the history of Peru she knew
far more than I. It was interesting to hear
from her lips the strange stories of the
conquering Pizzaro hosts, whose mailed
heels had once trod the ground we walked,
and clanked the knell of a fallen empire.</p>
<p>My school had been the school of adversity.
I had grown up with men who knew
or cared little for the finer sensibilities. I
felt that her standards of life were superior
to mine. Her loyalty to God and holy
charity toward the humblest soul, bent my
spirit to profound respect. She was one
who could see all there was of good in mankind
and could measure the product of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
one&rsquo;s powers and give them impulse and direction.
In my soul I bowed to the fair
graces of her character. Each day we met
I found in her some new wealth of noble
thoughts that created higher ideals in my
own untutored mind.</p>
<p>As time went on, fiercer rose the maddening
cries of war. I felt the hot blood
surge in my veins and I longed to be at the
front, amid the roar of cannon and the
clash of arms.</p>
<p>We were walking in a grove beneath the
swift glimmer of the tropical twilight,
when I told her that I felt it my duty to
fight for the land that had been the home
of my youth for so many years, and showed
her a letter in which I was offered an officer&rsquo;s
commission on the Huascar. She laid
her hand on my arm and said, &ldquo;There are
nobler things in life than the shedding of
the blood of fellow men. The youth of the
world goes out to fight for the empty glory
of another&rsquo;s crown. It is not on the field of
carnage that greatest honors are won, but
in the nobler, more peaceful pursuits of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
life, doing good and becoming leaders of
men and preventing war, that one wins the
royal diadem of him who said, &lsquo;peace on
earth, good will to men.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke in earnest eloquence, I
could have knelt and worshipped her. Her
delicate cheeks were flushed, and her eyes
were filled with tears.</p>
<p>No words of love had yet been spoken,
but the Barbarian knew and felt that he
had met his Ingomar.</p>

<h2>XVIII.</h2>
<h3>ON SUNNY SEAS BOUND NORTH.</h3>
</div>
<p>I met Mr. Robinson on the street one
day, bleeding from a wound on his face.
He said that Mr. Wood, superintendent of
our railway, had struck him. Two of Mr.
Wood&rsquo;s children were attending Miss Judson&rsquo;s
school, and on account of the official
position of their father, behaved in an ugly
manner. Miss Judson made complaint to
the school board, which exasperated Mr.
Wood and he demanded her resignation.
This the board would not permit. He called
Mr. Robinson to his office and dismissed
him from the service of the company. Being
requested by Mr. Robinson to give his
reasons for his dismissal, he struck him.</p>
<p>I was angry to think a young man would
so brutally use a man of Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s
age, and, too, in a strange country. Before
I could restrain myself I demanded his reason
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
for striking Mr. Robinson. Mr. Wood
replied in a haughty manner that he was
not accustomed to account for his acts. I
replied: &ldquo;Perhaps not, but when one of
your position and age so far forgets himself
as to strike an old man, any respect
you may be entitled to is dispelled by your
cowardly act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment it looked serious. He
raised his hand as if to strike me. I said:
&ldquo;Mr. Wood, if you attempt to go any farther
I will certainly be a far different antagonist
than Mr. Robinson, and teach you
that some of your acts, at least, will be rewarded
in a manner not to your liking.&rdquo;
He knew he had gone too far, and said in a
quieter tone, that he did not consider the
affair any of my business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robinson is an American; let his
countrymen investigate this matter. I will
deal with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wood,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;I hope the time
will never come when a Briton will so far
forget his duty as not to go to the assistance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
of any family, irrespective of nationality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment some other shop men
came in, loud in their denunciation of Mr.
Wood. There is something that binds a
Britisher and an American when they are
away from their respective countries, and
among strangers. On many occasions I
have seen the Britisher and American argue
and even quarrel over the merits of
their countries but when serious trouble
arose, all jealousies would be cast aside,
and each one would endeavor to outdo the
other in kindness.</p>
<p>That night an indignation meeting was
held in a large building formerly used as a
storeroom. The employes all knew the reason
of Mr. Wood&rsquo;s attack on Mr. Robinson.
Although the majority of them were working
under Mr. Wood, they felt the indignity
inflicted on Mr. Robinson was an insult to
them all, most of them having children attending
the school.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the school, Mr.
Wood had tried to dominate it. This was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
another reason for the employes&rsquo; grievances
and, chief of all, they were now being
paid in the depreciated currency of the
country. The meeting was conducted in a
quiet business manner. The sentiment was
to strike until Mr. Wood was removed from
office.</p>
<p>I told the men that that would be an injustice,
as the general manager was in
Lima and we had no one to appeal to.
Therefore we should continue to work until
we could communicate with him. This
appeal had the desired effect, as all could
see the injury our strike would inflict on
the railway.</p>
<p>I was then selected as the representative
of the employes to go to Lima and lay the
matter before the general manager. I was
about to start when I was handed a note
from the superintendent, saying that my
services were no longer required. I replied
that I would receive my orders from his
superior and proceeded on my journey.</p>
<p>At Lima I succeeded in reinstating Mr.
Robinson, and shortly after my return to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
Arequipa, Mrs. Robinson died. Grief at the
injury inflicted upon her husband and a
feeling of friendlessness in a foreign land,
had hastened her end. Another indignation
meeting was held and Mr. Wood was dismissed
from the service of the company.
Mr. Robinson became despondent and after
a few months decided to leave the country.</p>
<p>The war with Chile was still on. The
Peruvian army suffered defeat after defeat.
Her navy had made some show of
success at first, but not after the terrible
fight between the Huascar, and two Chile
ironclads, in which the Peruvians lost. The
currency of the country became practically
worthless. My accumulation of years was
almost swept away.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson decided to return to their
home in San Louis Obispo, California, and
about this time I received an offer from the
Peruvian government to bring a torpedo
boat from Panama to Mollendo. The
Robinson family were going north on the
steamer which would carry me to Panama.
On leaving, our friends gave us a splendid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
banquet and assembled at the station to
bid us farewell. Poor Chico, I can see him
yet, waving his old red handkerchief with
his right hand, his left covering his eyes.</p>
<p>When the ship moved out of the port, I
stood on the deck with Hattie. Mr. Robinson
and the aged mother stood near us
looking upon the scene amid a flood of
tears. The memory of their dead they
were leaving behind, was no doubt uppermost
in their minds.</p>
<p>I looked upon the mountains we were
just leaving until they were a mere speck.
I intended to perform one last service for
Peru, for, however much I had suffered, it
was my boyhood&rsquo;s home, the only home I
had had since leaving my native shores.</p>
<p>We were a week making the voyage from
Mollendo to Panama. The weather was
fine and the sea was smooth. I was in company
with Hattie much of the time. In her
gentle way, she sought to dissuade me from
the perilous undertaking with the torpedo
boat. But when I reminded her of my duty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
to Peru she said no more. I could see, however,
she was pained at the thought.</p>
<p>The north bound steamer had gone when
we arrived at Panama and the Robinsons
would have to wait ten days, which compelled
them to stay at the hotel in that sultry
city.</p>
<p>After visiting the Peruvian consul, who
had been notified of my mission by his
government, I learned that a Chilean cruiser
was watching the torpedo boat and it
was decided to await a dark night when we
could escape from Panama harbor. Meantime
I stopped at the same hotel with the
Robinsons. I made several trips around
the bay to test the speed of the boat and
was satisfied we could outrun the cruiser,
but somehow I began to dread the venture.
The full force of this feeling dawned on
me when I realized I was in love with
Hattie.</p>
<p>The day was drawing near for their departure,
when Hattie and I were seated on
the veranda of the hotel, looking out over
the Pacific. The afternoon wore away, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
sun began to set in the dense blue haze of
the tropic ocean, the great cathedral bells
pealed out the hour of eight, the night birds
screeched from out the palms, and still we
sat in the glow of the twilight, talking of
our past and future.</p>
<p>The streets became silent and even some
stars had faded from the skies and the
ceaseless roar of the surf beating upon
the sands was music, when she promised to
be my wife.</p>

<h2>XIX.</h2>
<h3>DEATH SHIPS OF THE SEA.</h3>
</div>
<p>A thick fog rose from the sea, as we
stole away in the darkness with the torpedo
boat. We had no distinguishing lights
and every sound was muffled. Even the
funnels were protected against the tell-tale
sparks of soft coal. The spume of the sea
fell over our forward deck in flecks, and
the waves splashed at our bow. The harbor
lights of Panama shone in a glow of
sickly yellow.</p>
<p>An officer stood by the hooded binnacle,
watching our course by the faint glow of a
tiny lamp. The bulldog engines, which I
was working, were speeding us at 17 knots
an hour and we were headed for Mollendo.
We had no armament. That was sent to
the Peruvian government by other means
and our only defense against the Chilean
cruiser was a clean pair of heels.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>Suddenly, the eye of a search-light opened,
and sent a long gleam of yellow into
the fog. It swung around and rested for
a moment on the column of smoke trailing
from our funnels and changed its color
from a black to a fiery red. It rested there
a moment, then closed and all was darkness.
The tumult was deafening. The
hissing rush of projectiles, as they struck
the water and exploded by impact, or
shrieked in ricochet overhead.</p>
<p>The brave officer at the binnacle fell to
the deck, his mangled body a quivering
mass. One funnel was struck midway and
cut in twain as though by a sharpened
blade. Fire darted up from the half funnel,
and showed the cruiser&rsquo;s gunners the
correctness of their aim. It lit our deck
with its glare and showed the bodies of two
others on the forward deck bathed in blood.
Another officer coolly took his place at the
binnacle and directed a change in the
course of the boat.</p>
<p>The spurting jets of fire from our broken
funnel gleamed in the fog, like a beacon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
light to those on board the gaunt black
monster of the seas, in pursuit of his prey.
A hunted thing on the black waves, we
crowded on every ounce of steam throughout
the watches of the night.</p>
<p>With the morning came the blaze of the
tropic sun. It drove the fog off the sea
and showed us the hull of the cruiser, looming
up out of the purple mist. Steadily, we
held our course, with steam up to the danger
line. By noon we had gained a little,
and again, with the approach of night, the
fog began to rise and soon enveloped us in
its grey cloak. But that beacon light from
our funnel shone hateful as its spurting
jets flashed signals to the enemy in pursuit.</p>
<p>Another night passed, and, when the fog
lifted again, there was the vampire even
nearer than before.</p>
<p>The nervous strain was telling on our
crew. The day before we joked and laughed&ndash;&ndash;we
would outrun him yet in the night.
We would have; but for the glare from that
funnel. We might have stolen into some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
cove and let him pass us in the dark, but for
that. He did not waste shot anymore, we
were going his way. He could afford to
wait. The third day the crew was worn
and silent. They had the look of desperation
in their faces, as they threw furtive
glances back at the spectre, the Ship of
Death&ndash;&ndash;The Black Coffin&ndash;&ndash;we called him
now.</p>
<p>At high noon, we met an American warship.
His crew crowded to his decks and
gave cheer after cheer in sympathy for our
desperate plight. The big greyhound of
the sea was chasing the rabbit he had bitten
and maimed, and the sympathy was
with the weak. By night the nervous strain
had become almost a frenzy. Then to add
to our peril, the coal in the bunkers was
running low. Something must happen in
our favor soon. Our signal still flashed
from the half funnel&ndash;&ndash;our signal of distress&ndash;&ndash;and
by midnight we called it our
funeral candle. The sky was clear now
and the stars were shining. We could see
lights flash now and then through the haze
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
of the sea. When morning came there he
was big, black, hideous&ndash;&ndash;still in our wake.</p>
<p>Coal for eight more hours only. Surely
something would happen; help must come,
out of the sea, out of the sky, out of somewhere,
only it must come. The sea was
smooth; not a ship could be seen on the
horizon. All on board were in restless
anxiety. Only coal for three more hours.</p>
<p>We were now off Ecuador. The officer
in command called the crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to surrender the boat,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>The assistant engineer, two stokers and
myself, all of us British, shouted &ldquo;Never!
We are not here to lay in a Chilean prison
and perhaps be shot! We beach the boat!&rdquo;
Our emphasis was our drawn revolvers.</p>
<p>Without a word, the officer headed the
boat for the shore. We gathered up a few
edibles and when we grounded the boat,
swam to the beach. The officer lingered
for some time after all were ashore, then
hurried over her sides and made his escape.
The Chilean cruiser launched her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
boat, eight sailors to each side of rowlocks,
an ensign and a party of marines.
They rowed rapidly to the torpedo boat and
half of them climbed on board, when her
sides parted and a terrific flame shot upward,
bearing the bodies of a dozen men.
The officer had lit the fuse that did the
work.</p>
<p>Ten days afterwards the two stokers,
assistant engineer and myself, footsore and
ragged, went on board the British mail
steamer at Guay&aacute;quil and presented ourselves
to the gruff old captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get below in the stoke-hole and black
up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Chilean government offers
five thousand dollars reward for each
of you. If we are searched you are stokers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on board another ship far to
the north were aching hearts. Hattie&rsquo;s
aged mother fell ill when two days out from
Panama and the next day she passed away.
Rules required that the body be buried at
sea. It was a solemn group that assembled
at the ship&rsquo;s gangway, while all that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
was mortal of the aged mother rested on a
plank, one end of which was held by a
sailor. Slowly the chaplain read the beautiful
service. The ship was stopped. Not
a sound was heard and the midnight moon
was hidden by clouds. &ldquo;Therefore we commit
this body to the deep,&rdquo; was pronounced.
The plank was raised and the
body was swallowed up in the cavernous
depths of the ocean.</p>
<p>Hattie leaned upon the arm of Mr. Robinson,
who tenderly escorted her to the cabin
when the rites were over. To her the
world was gloomy and desolate, her sister
but recently buried in far away Arequipa
and the mother now in the sea. With a
fortitude beyond her years the Christian
girl bore bravely her deep sorrows, trusting
in Him &ldquo;who doeth all things well.&rdquo;
When the ship reached the open roadstead
of Port Harford, and she again landed on
the shores of her native California, she
went to her former home&ndash;&ndash;a vine-clad cottage
in San Louis Obispo.</p>
<p>It was here I found her some weeks after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
I assumed the role of stoker on the British
mail steamer. Mr. Robinson had gone to
his former home in Missouri, but Hattie
was protected by relatives. We talked
of our coming marriage. It was not possible
at that time. I had lost so much money
by exchange from the paper currency of
Peru to the gold of California, that I needed
time to replenish my almost depleted
purse. We decided that we would wait one
year, meanwhile I would go to Arizona and
run an engine on the railroad east of
Tuscon.</p>
<p>It made my heart glad to be in a country
once more where my own language was
spoken and among people whose customs
were like unto that of my native land.
There was no prejudice toward me on account
of my foreign birth, such as I had
often encountered in Peru. The hand of
fellowship was extended in this broad free
land of the United States, where the
greatness of men is measured almost by
merit alone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>What surprised me at first was the absence
of soldiers until I came to understand
the peace-loving disposition of the people,
and learned that in the hour of the country&rsquo;s
need, all men became her defenders.</p>
<p>It was one of those balmy afternoons, so
characteristic of southern California, when
Hattie and I were seated in a park overlooking
the beautiful Los Ossis valley. Our
plans were made for the future, and I was
to leave that night for Arizona. It was
the tender parting of man and woman
whose lives had been seared by the hot
irons of adversity, and each felt that the
other was the one and all upon this planet.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Here Buchan&rsquo;s narrative was broken
short. He was writing the last chapter on
a pair of ladies&rsquo; dainty cuffs, when he
stopped and listened. He arose to his feet.
&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I thought a
moment ago I heard something&ndash;&ndash;her
voice.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XX.</h2>
<h3>A DAUGHTER OF THE CHEROKEES.</h3>
</div>
<p>Mary Greenwater was not the ugly,
coarse-featured woman that many squaws
are. She possessed many of the fine features
of her white sisters. She had been
well educated at the Carlisle Indian
school, and had traveled much. While, with
other Cherokee Indians, she drew her annuities
from the government, yet she was
known to be the wealthiest woman of the
tribe. She was lavish in the expenditure
of money. Her home in the Cherokee hills
was elaborately furnished with the richest
of carpets and furniture; even a grand
piano adorned her parlor. But with all its
costly appointments, the house was a wilderness
of disorder. Like other of her
race, she despised anything akin to neatness.
Her dresses were gaudy in color and
extravagant in style. Pearl necklaces, diamond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
brooches and rings were worn on all
occasions. She owned fine carriages and
many spirited horses. As a horsewoman,
she was an expert and as a pistol shot she
was accounted the best in the Cherokee nation.
Her servants were the half-breed Indian
Negroes to whom her word was as
absolute a law as any Caliph ever possessed
over a tribe. She was accustomed to command,
and if disobeyed she enforced her
orders at the point of the revolver she always
carried.</p>
<p>The source of Mary Greenwater&rsquo;s
wealth was a mystery. Those of her tribe
gave themselves no concern about it, but
the matter was a subject of much comment
among the few white men in the territory.
Mercer, a young man of adventurous spirit,
hearing of her fabulous wealth, sought
her hand in marriage. After the wedding,
he used all his arts to wring from her the
secret of her riches. Once when she started
on one of her lone journeys to the hills
of the Grand River, he attempted to follow
and that was the last ever seen or heard of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
him. That the woman possessed the secret
of a vast amount of lost treasure was evident,
as she spent many Spanish gold coins
of ancient date as months rolled on, and
this induced Grim, a farm hand, to marry
her. She elevated him from a menial position,
to overseer of her ranch. She gave
him money, which he recklessly spent at
the faro tables at the Garrison. When she
refused to further indulge him in his reckless
expenditures, he, like Mercer, attempted
to follow her on her journey to the
Grand River hills one night. He was missed
by his companions who went in numbers
to search for him, taking an Indian
guide. They were led in an opposite direction
from the way he went and his fate
remained a mystery, until many months
later his body was found in the Grand River,
with a bullet in the brain.</p>
<p>Two years after the death of Grim, Carson
and a negro were hunting in the Grand
River country and were encamped one
night in the hills. While seated beside their
campfire, they heard a cry of distress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
Upon going to the spot, they found a lone
Indian woman pinioned beneath her pony,
which had stepped into a wolf hole and
broke its leg. The woman was badly injured
and they carried her to their campfire
and made her comfortable. The next
day they constructed a rude litter and carried
her twenty miles to a place where she
could receive medical attention.</p>
<p>The woman was Mary Greenwater, and
this was, perhaps, the first act of kindness
she had ever received.</p>
<p>A certain escapade at the close of Carson&rsquo;s
college days had caused him to migrate
to the West, where, like many others,
he became a soldier of fortune, drifting
whither the strongest tide wind blew.
When Mary Greenwater recovered she
sought him, and in her gratitude made
him the overseer of her ranch at a princely
salary.</p>
<p>In course of time they were married by
the ancient Indian ceremony of the Fastest
Horse. When the days of feasting
were over, and Mary Greenwater&rsquo;s relatives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
had returned to their cabins richer by
a number of ponies, Mary told Carson a
wondrous story of how, many summers
ago, when her grandfather was a boy, a
Spanish caravan came from Santa Fe and
was besieged in the Grand river hills for
many days, and of how, finding that they would
eventually be starved to death if
they remained, the travelers had hidden
their possessions among the lime rocks and
undertaken to cut their way through the
Indian hordes to a place of safety. Her
grandfather had found the hiding place of
the treasure and had kept it a profound
secret from all except herself, to whom he
told it only when he began to sing his death
song.</p>
<p>Mary Greenwater swore to Carson that
the hiding place of the Spanish treasure
would never be known except to one other
member of her tribe, and then not until
after her death. She told him there were
valuable papers which she knew none of
her people could ever use, and which she
later gave to Carson.</p>

<p>The documents were discolored and the
ink faded and this much Carson was able
to decipher: &ldquo;Jean Maldonado visited a
far distant country north of Santa Fe&ndash;&ndash;a
wide valley through which flowed a stream,
along the banks were bushes that bore fruit
like unto those of Spain&ndash;&ndash;in the valley
were herds of oxen of the bigness and color
of our bulls&ndash;&ndash;their horns are not so great&ndash;&ndash;they
have a great bunch upon their fore
shoulders and more hair on the forepart
than on the hindpart; they have a horse&rsquo;s
mane upon their backbone and much hair
and very long from the knees downward&ndash;&ndash;they
have great tufts of hair hanging
from their foreheads and it seemeth they
have beards&ndash;&ndash;they push with their horns&ndash;&ndash;they
overtake and kill a horse&ndash;&ndash;finally it is
a fierce beast of countenance and form of
body&ndash;&ndash;we feared these beasts and stayed
near the mountains named the Sangre de
Christo.... Climbed the
mountain to a great flat rock that stood on
end like a platter.... Jean Maldonado,
commander of an expedition reached this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
place 1750.... The mine yielded
much gold in a rock like white china&ndash;&ndash;Babtiste
beat it out with&ndash;&ndash;Mattheo returned
from Santa Fe with more donkeys&ndash;&ndash;loaded
donkeys with much unbeaten rock&ndash;&ndash;returned
to Santa Fe&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>Here the ink was so faded that nothing
more could be made of the manuscript.
The accompanying map was more perfect.
The tracings showed the mountain ranges.
It had been drawn almost with the precision
of an engineer. The route from Santa
Fe through the mountain passes was
clearly shown; there were marks of each
day&rsquo;s stops. Where the map showed the
end of the journey there was the rude
drawing of a cliff set on edge and below it
was marked &ldquo;Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carson pondered over the quaint document
for many days. The Indian marriage
with Mary Greenwater had become
a matter of regret. While the woman
loved him, yet her love was like a new
bowie knife, to be handled with care. He
decided to leave the Grand River country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
and bide his time until Mary Greenwater
should make one of her long visits to the
hills. One night he mounted the best
horse on the ranch and driving thirty others
ahead of him, set out for Colorado. On
the way he sold most of the horses to
ranchmen and cattlemen and netted a neat
sum.</p>
<p>When Mary Greenwater returned and
found her spouse had vanished, her fury
knew no bounds. Ordinarily the Indian
squaw might be deserted by her lord and
she would stoically accept her fate. Mary
might have done so had she not been
spoiled by being educated at Carlisle. Her
savage blood grew hot for revenge. She
made another trip to the Grand river hills,
presumably for a larger amount of money,
placed her affairs in the hands of her Indian-Negro
servants, and started on the
trail of Carson, believing she would have
no trouble in overtaking a man driving
that many head of horses. Meanwhile the
fall rains set in and the shallow rivers of
the plains became raging torrents. But to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
a woman of Mary Greenwater&rsquo;s determined
character, these things were obstacles only
for the time being. Her heart was bad and
her love of revenge strong.</p>

<h2>XXI.</h2>
<h3>CARSON&rsquo;S BLANK PAGES IN LIFE.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Carson left the cabin he followed
the winding trail that led to the valley below.
The road to Saguache showed the
hoofprints of a prospector&rsquo;s outfit, and the
marks of a sleigh leading to Del Norte.
The glare of the sun on the reflected snow
was blinding and he drew his hat down
over his eyes. He was thinking of his
worthless life since leaving college. Once
he had builded lofty hopes of future doings
in the world, but he had allowed himself
to drift; his ship of fate had gone
wherever the strongest tide wind carried.
He saw now that he might have marked out
some honorable career and piloted his
course toward it. Others of his class in
college were in a fair way to make their
mark in the world. Why was it not so
with him? It was born in him, as it had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
been in his father, to choose the wild life of
the frontier in preference to holding the
presidency of a bank in Atlanta. He felt
that the world in its wildest freedom was
his for his pleasure. The cords of restraint
which society demanded were to
him the fetters of a tyrant ruler, and so,
as Sampson broke the green withes which
bound him, Carson broke the laws of society&ndash;&ndash;nay
civilization, and married a
squaw according to the ceremony of her
people. He repented the act to some extent,
and then cast his cares aside, with
the comforting knowledge that the world
was too busy a place for people to give
themselves much concern over his affairs.
Long ago he realized that if he threw himself
into the swirl of humanity and allowed
himself to become a part of its motives and
its emotions, that it would require a herculean
effort to attain a position where he
could look over the heads of other men.
That position, he argued, was not worth
the life-long effort required. Withal, he
could not bring himself to quite understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
why he had married Mary Greenwater,
unless that she possessed some occult
power and gained control over forces
of his nature which he did not understand.
True, there was but little or no obligation
to the ceremony. It held good in the Cherokee
Indian nation, that government within
a government. Outside that limited
space of ground it was null and void. He
was a free man under the laws of his own
government. Yet that act, of his own creation,
somehow seemed to stand over him
like a Frankenstein with an uplifted axe.</p>
<p>The snow was deep, and as he plodded
along with these thoughts running through
his mind, he heard a cry. Glancing backwards
he saw a horse drawing a sleigh,
plunging madly down the road. The reins
were held by a woman, frantically urging
the horse forward. Some distance behind
four huge mountain lions were in hot
pursuit, their heavy bodies crouching and
springing forward many feet at a leap.
Carson took in the situation at a glance
and, raising his hand as a signal to the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
in the sleigh to rein in, he sprang into the
vehicle as she passed. The momentary
pause had given the beasts a chance to
gain, when, drawing his revolver, he fired
at the foremost and sent it rolling in the
snow. Another shot and a second lion
paused with a mighty roar. At this the
other two turned and fled in the opposite
direction.</p>
<p>Carson now took the reins and stopped
the horse. The animal was trembling with
fright, while the girl was calm but pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a close shave, eh, Sis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;how fortunate
you were here. I was driving to Del Norte
when I met the lions. They were gamboling
in the snow like kittens. When I
turned Bess, they pursued. I want the
one you have just killed, I want to have
him mounted to remember today,&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, Miss, you shall have it,
but where are you going now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to Saguache after this fright.
Poor Old Bess could not have stood the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
race much farther. See how she trembles.
I am the niece of Mr. Amos. My name is
Annie Amos. I have friends in Del Norte,
whom I intended to visit. I shall wait now
until I have an escort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah&ndash;&ndash;my name is Carson&ndash;&ndash;Jack Carson.
I was going to Saguache to see Mr. Amos,
the assayer, to have him test a jug handle,&ndash;&ndash;er,
that is, to have the jug handle test
him. I don&rsquo;t mean that; I mean our mine is
named the Jug Handle, I will get it right
after awhile, and I want him to make a test
of the ore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo; he thought as he turned
the horse, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the sense of a jackrabbit
to make a break like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the lions lay pawing the snow in
its death struggle and as Carson came
near, it reared itself as if to make one last
leap. Its eyes gleamed in savage yellow,
foam fell in flecks from its mouth, while a
tiny stream of crimson stained the snow.
Carson&rsquo;s weapon spit fire and the creature
rolled over motionless. He dragged the
carcass to the end of the sleigh and, lifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
it upon the edge of the box, made it fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to Saguache to see
my uncle, I fear you will be disappointed
as he left this morning for an absence of
several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does not matter as I have other
business anyway. Most any time will do,
as I am in town quite often. We would
better not drive so fast. Your horse is in
a foam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carson was fast becoming interested in
the girl at his side. Her calm poise, after
the exciting adventures with the mountain
lions, surprised him. Other women would
have been hysterical, but here by his side
sat a girl not yet out of her teens, as calm
and collected as a veteran soldier after the
battle. And Amos, the man he was going
to see and intended to kill if he proved to
be the villain he suspected him to be, was
her uncle.</p>
<p>The white billows rose rank on rank on
the distant mountains, while the snow of
the valley shrunk visibly away, leaving the
grey rocks naked and protuberant.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>The newly-made acquaintances chatted
gaily as the horse jogged along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of your remark awhile
ago,&rdquo; said Carson, &ldquo;that you would go to
Del Norte tomorrow if you had an escort,
and as I have some time to idle away it
would give me pleasure to drive you over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would give me equal pleasure to have
you do so,&rdquo; she replied with admirable
frankness, &ldquo;that is, if you are going there
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may need to purchase some new implements
with which to work the Aberdeen&ndash;&ndash;I
mean the Jug Handle mine,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;I have heard of a new drill they
are working over there and it may be just
the thing for the formation we are now in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the girl, as a mischievous
smile flitted about her lips, &ldquo;and I am very
glad you will accompany me. I shall make
you acquainted with some of my very dear
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carson was forgetting his millions in
the mine and letting his mind wander to
the expected joys of entertaining and being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
entertained by people of real worth
once more. He felt returning pride, and
then the thought of the Frankenstein
with the uplifted axe made him groan inwardly.
But pshaw! she did not know&ndash;&ndash;never
would know, and what people do not
know will not hurt them, he reasoned.</p>
<p>He felt an increasing admiration for the
girl beside him. They were alone in the
wide expanse of valley and had known each
other only an hour, yet this girl was willing
to trust to his honor and manhood.
And be it said for Carson, as it may be said
for thousands of other men on the American
frontier, he would have yielded his life
rather than betray that sacred trust. Instances
like this are common in the West.</p>
<p>As they drove down the main street of
Saguache, the passers looked curiously
at the pair in the sleigh and at the dead
lion strapped behind. When they stopped
in front of the postoffice, a crowd gathered
around the sleigh. A supple figure edged
through the crowd and addressed the girl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill it all by yourself, Annie?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>The familiarity with which he spoke nettled
the girl, and she turned her head without
answering. The supple figure felt the
rebuff and all the more because others noticed
it. He stood his ground, however,
until Carson returned and when he saw his
face he quickly drew out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow at seven,&rdquo; said Carson, as
he bade her good-bye at her house.</p>
<p>Carson went to his hotel with a lighter
heart than he had had for months. He lit
a cigar and sat by the window, then felt
for something in his pocket, and threw it
in the wood-box. &ldquo;There are other jug
handles,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>He walked the streets aimlessly until
supper. He retired early and tried to
sleep, but his thoughts ran wild on the
events of the day. He could think of no
one except Annie. It was still early in the
night, when he arose from a restless bed
and went out on the streets. Lights blazed
from the Lone Tree saloon, and as he entered
he saw a crowd about the faro table.
The sudden exclamations of many voices
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
told that some one was winning heavily.
He pressed forward through the crowd
and saw the form of a woman. When she
partially turned her face, he felt his heart
give a great throb, and he fled into the
street.</p>
<p>The remainder of the night he walked
through the crunching snow, while the
silent stars seemed to gaze with tearful
eyes upon him in this, the greatest misery
he had ever known. He walked several
miles out of town to avoid meeting anyone
he knew and then presented himself at the
Amos residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is seven o&rsquo;clock, Miss Annie,&rdquo;
he said, when she answered his call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I am ready,&rdquo; was the cheerful
answer.</p>

<h3>A VOICE FROM CENTURIES PAST.</h3>
</div>
<p>Buchan was ready to throw the lever of
his engine and roll out of Tucson, when a
messenger handed him a packet bearing
the postmark of Peru. The missive showed
signs of age, and, having traveled much,
had reached its destination at last. He
tossed it into his tool box and an hour later
when speeding over the scorched deserts of
Arizona, he opened the packet. The letter
was dated at Truxillo and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Don Juan&ndash;&ndash;I have been ill for
many months, and I feel that my end is
drawing nigh, but before I go I want to do
something for you. I have heard how Don
Rodrigo so justly met his end, and with
this knowledge I die easier. You are young
and strong, with a long life of usefulness
ahead, and I feel that in entrusting to you
a family secret, I am only doing that which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
I would have done had Felicita lived. She
was the last of our house and the heritage
of our family belonged to her. As it is, I
make you my heir to the valuable papers
handed down to me from my ancestors.
May they prove to you a blessing. Would
that I had more to give you. May the
blessings of the Virgin ever rest upon
you.</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ldquo;Julian.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accompanying the letter was a parchment
scroll, dated Lima, 1752. It read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Jean Maldonado, do write of my
extraordinary adventures in Nueva Espanola,
wherein I was duly appointed the
Commander of an expedition to the land of
Quivera, in search of the Seven Cities of
Cibola, in the service of his excellency, the
viceroy of Santa Fe. A barbarian told us
he would lead us unto a land to the far
north, where shops blazed with jewels and
common cooking vessels were made of
gold; that the metal was so common as to
be of no value. The king of this city took
his noonday meals beneath a golden canopy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
hung with tinkling silver bells.
There was a sea upon which this king rode
in a canoe, which would carry twenty
horses. Upon its prow was an idol of beaten
gold. The canoe was fitted with sumptuous
cushions, upon which the monarch
took his siestas, to the music made by
dancing maidens with bells and castanets.
Fish as large as horses abounded, and
sweet fruit bigger than a soldier&rsquo;s helmet
grew upon the trees. The monarch who
ruled over this land was long-bearded,
white-haired, and wore robes of bright-hued,
rich stuffs, and slept in a garden
where trees were hung with a thousand
bells, which made exquisite music when
shaken by the wind. And this king worshipped
the golden image of a woman, the
Queen of Heaven, and ate from gold and
silver bowls, of which the dais he sat upon
was made. He spoke with vast assurance
and said he would conduct us thither whenever
we should follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We journeyed northward many leagues
over mountains and came to a wide valley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
watered by a stream. Farther on were
high mountains and we named them Sangre
de Christo and marked three mountains
&lsquo;Spanish Peaks&rsquo; on our map, that we
might not miss our way. One day a pious
soldier saw the barbarian with his face in a
pool of water, talking with the devil. After
that we were suspicious. After many days&rsquo;
journey we found the city, but alas, it was
mud huts, and the only metal was a copper
plate around the old chief&rsquo;s neck and by
which he sat great store. There were no
golden vessels, no image of the Virgin, no
golden dais and no silver bells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wicked barbarian then said he
had led us into the desert to die. Our soldiers
were wroth and I ordered him hanged
on a considerable tree, to let him know
there was a God in heaven and a King in
Spain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We turned our steps backward after
we had set up a cross, and journeyed into
the valley. Now there were many oxen
come into the valley of the figure and color
of our bulls, but their horns were not so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
great. They had a great bunch upon their
fore shoulders and more hair upon their
fore parts than on their hind parts. They
had a horse&rsquo;s mane upon their backbone
and much hair from the knees downward.
They had great tufts of hair hanging from
their foreheads and it seemeth that they
had beards, because of the great store of
hair at their chins and throats. In some
respects they resembled a lion, and in some
others the camel. They pushed with their
horns, and they overtook and killed horses.
Finally, it was a foul and fierce beast of
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have stayed close to the mountains
where we could flee to the rocks if they
pursued us. We were crossing the mountain,
when we came upon a spring near
unto a huge cliff that sat on the edge like
a platter. We camped here many days until
the bulls left the valley. Some distance
from the rock like a platter, Casteanda
found gold in a white rock, which we did
beat up and saved much pure gold. Casteanda
journeyed to Santa Fe and returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
with more donkeys, and we loaded
upon them much unbeaten rock. We all
then journeyed back to Santa Fe, for the
barbarians were angry at our intrusion
and we went in haste, leaving more gold
in the white rock than would load a ship&rsquo;s
boat. I cut in the rock, high up, the words:</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jean Maldonado.<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Commander of an Expedition, reached this place, 1750.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this, so that the subjects of Spain
might know this country belonged to His
Majesty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We journeyed back to Santa Fe after
many days of hardships and we found a
new Viceroy had been appointed and he
demanded our gold. This we were loath
to give up, and after selling it to a trader
for the coin of the realm, we started across
the country for New Orleans, knowing well
not to go south for the new Viceroy would
pursue us and take the gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We journeyed along the banks of a considerable
river by night and hid ourselves
by day. We saw many thousands of ferocious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
bulls grazing, and when they ran the
noise was like thunder and it made us
afraid. We crossed many rivers and finally
came to a country of wooded hills
where the Barbarians were thick and ferocious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Barbarians pursued us and we
hid our gold and records in a cave and
rolled a stone over the hole and fled. They
killed nearly all of our expedition and our
mules. Baptiste was sorely wounded in
the breast with an arrow and notwithstanding
we bled him copiously, he died.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treatment given us by the Barbarians
irritated us exceedingly and we fell
upon them with swords when they were not
in great numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came to a river whose waters were
red, like unto the color of the tiles on
the houses of Seville, and after journeying
along its banks for many nights, we came
unto the River of the Holy Ghost, which
DeSoto discovered and here we found
safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While all these things were new in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
mind I made another map in order that I
might take another expedition to the mine
when the Viceroy grew rich from the spoils
of office and would trouble us no more. But
he did write unto the people of Spain that
I would be hanged upon my return to Santa
Fe, therefore I desisted in returning.
Being extremely irritated at his conduct I
sought my fortune in Peru, until such time
when he should be called to heaven, which
call even now, in my old age, has not yet
been made, over which misfortune I have
sorely grieved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accompanying this document was a map
with the Sangre de Christo range, the
Spanish Peaks, the River, Valley and flat
cliff on edge, plainly marked. The distance
from Santa Fe and the mountain passes
was clearly indicated.</p>
<p>A month later Buchan was transferred
on a run out of Santa Fe where the hand
of Fate and Chance again took part. He
received a letter from Mr. Robinson who
had joined a surveying party and had fallen
ill at Saguache. The letter implored
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
him to come, if he ever expected to see him
alive. True to his old time friendship, he
lost no time in reaching his bedside. Mr.
Robinson lingered a few weeks and died.
This was more sad news for Hattie in her
far-away home, amid the Santa Lucia
mountains. She alone remained of the
happy family who had gone to Arequipa
with fond hopes for the future beneath
those sunny skies.</p>
<p>I, the writer, had been with Carson a
few days before prospecting in the Sangre
de Christo mountains, when by chance we
rested at the spring beside the peculiar
shaped cliff. I noticed that Carson was interested
in the surroundings, but I thought
nothing of it at the time. The formation
of the cliff appealed to my fancy, and I
chanced to mention it to Buchan one day
when he became excited and asked to be
shown its whereabouts.</p>
<p>Together with Carson we visited the
spot. Being an old prospector, I soon discovered
formations that looked like pay
ore. My years of experience in these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
mountains had taught me that a man
might work a lifetime and gain nothing,
and again from the outcroppings of a stone
at grass roots he might develop a mine
worth a million dollars.</p>
<p>Carson and Buchan were sanguine over
our prospects, too much so, I thought, for
men who had no experience in mining.</p>
<p>I located the claim so as to include the
cliff and spring and when I made out the
registration papers, I said: &ldquo;Gentlemen,
what shall we call the mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it the Maldonado,&rdquo; said Carson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Buchan, turning an
ashen paleness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Major Domo,&rdquo; replied Carson,
looking somewhat abashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name it the Aberdeen,&rdquo; said Buchan.
&ldquo;I like to hear that name spoken, it was
my old home in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE TWO OLD BLACK CROWS.</h3>
</div>
<p>Amos sat in the little back room of Rayder&rsquo;s
office in Denver. His beady black eyes
glistened beneath his beetle brows. A
pleased expression shone on his thin face,
drawn in wrinkles like stained parchment.
Rayder was out, but had left instructions
for him to wait. As he sat there his eye
caught sight of something interesting on
Rayder&rsquo;s desk. The door was closed and
he was alone. He leaned forward and took
up some slips of paper for closer inspection.
They were certificates of assay from
Pendleton. The pleased look vanished as
he noted Amos No. 1, Amos No. 2, Amos
No. 3, and so on for a dozen or more slips.
Rayder did not trust him, and had had the
sample of ore assayed by Pendleton for
corroboration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not even believe in honesty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
among thieves,&rdquo; he mused, as he carefully
replaced the papers. Then the pleased
look came back to his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the better,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He will
deal now and it is my time to strike before
the iron cools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew his chair further back from the
desk, and pretended to be reading a newspaper
when he heard Rayder coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the man I have been wanting to
see,&rdquo; said Rayder, extending his hand,
&ldquo;how is everything in Saguache and how is
Annie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie is handsome as ever, but there is
a new assayer coming to town next month
and I understand he is on the dead square,
and what we do we have got to do all-fired
quick. How is this for an eye-opener?&rdquo;
He took from his pocket several lumps of
shining ore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sylvanite,&rdquo; exclaimed Rayder. &ldquo;What
does it run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighty ounces to the ton. There is a
quarter of a million dollars on the dump
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
and the fellows think it is copper and
pyrites of iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would it do to contest the claim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous business, they have taken
to killing claim jumpers. One was shot
last week, and this outfit will shoot, no
mistake. It is better to buy them out for
a song. They are about broke anyway.
They believe everything I tell them, have
a child-like confidence in me, same as
everybody has. I tell you, Rayder, I stand
at the top in the estimation of everybody,
and all we have got to do is to have the
buyer on the ground, and when they come
in with their next samples I will prove to
them their values have run out, show them
some rich stuff from down the valley and
like all others of their class, they will
stampede.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds good, but tell me more of
Annie, did she appreciate the cloak I sent
her for a Christmas present?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appreciate it! I should say she did.
She just worships it because it came from
you, and say, she has your photograph on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
the wall where she can see it all the time.
She just dotes on that picture. I tell her
there is the chance of her life, a fine house,
fine clothes, a chance to go abroad and
cultivate her musical talent, become a
great singer and meet dukes and lords and
crowned heads. Why, the girl is just crazy
over you, and I believe she would marry
you even if you did not have a cent. It is
like marrying December to May, you sixty
and she nineteen, pretty and vivacious&ndash;&ndash;warm
up your old bones, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rayder&rsquo;s eyes shone and he stroked his
beard with delight. &ldquo;Charley,&rdquo; he called
to his office boy, &ldquo;bring up a quart of
whisky, some lemons and sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet creature, I love thee,&rdquo; said
Amos a few minutes later, holding up a
half goblet of whisky. &ldquo;You do the proper
thing in setting out these kind of glasses;
puts me in mind of my old home down in
Texas, where we never drink out of anything
smaller than a tin cup or a gourd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is to Annie and Rayder&ndash;&ndash;may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
your posterity become presidents and
wives of presidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink hearty,&rdquo; said Rayder, emptying
his glass, which he had filled to the fullness
of Amos&rsquo; out of compliment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charley, bring up a box of perfectos,&rdquo;
he shouted. &ldquo;You may then lock up and
go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glasses were again drained and the
two black crows chattered until the streets
were growing quiet for the night. Supper
was forgotten in the love feast of Amos
and Rayder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Amos, I always did love
you just like a brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, too, Rayder, you know the first
time we saw each other, I sez to myself&ndash;&ndash;I
sez&ndash;&ndash;there is a man that would stick to a
friend through thick and thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are that kind of a man yourself,
Amos, is the reason you have a good opinion
of me. I never had a friend in distress
yet that I didn&rsquo;t help him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Rayder, that&rsquo;s right.
Them&rsquo;s the qualities that go to make up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
nature&rsquo;s noblemen. Lord, if I had a known
you years ago we&rsquo;d a bin millionaires&ndash;&ndash;my
knowledge of mines and your sagacity.
That&rsquo;s what counts, and you never fail in
your estimate of men, either. Lord, you
was born under lucky stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take another drink, Rayder, take a
cistern full. &rsquo;Taint often we meet on auspicious
occasions like this, and we won&rsquo;t go
home &rsquo;till mornin,&rsquo; and we won&rsquo;t go home
&rsquo;till morning, hic&ndash;&ndash;hurrah for Annie, Rayder,
and a million outer the mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; she shame short of share of prosperity
to my brother Amos,&rdquo; and Rayder
took another drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shay, Rayder, you come and go home
with me and hang around a day or two
until you buy the mine and play sweet
with Annie, an&rsquo; the night of the weddin&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll hev a dance and send you away on
your bridal tour in a blaze of glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, I&rsquo;ll do it, Amos, an&rsquo; then
we&rsquo;ll be almost brothers &rsquo;cordin&rsquo; ter law,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shay, Rayder, did I tell ye I had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
little mix up with a woman, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m scared
to death &rsquo;fear old woman &rsquo;ill find it out.
I got &rsquo;ter square the deal or I&rsquo;m a goner
and stuff&rsquo;s all off, want yer to let me take
ten thousand fer few days, got ter blow a
lot o&rsquo; money on weddin&rsquo;, too, yer see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Amos, youse&rsquo;s square a man&rsquo;s
ever met. I&rsquo;ll let ye hev it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, thet&rsquo;s relief; sooner I get it easier
mind&rsquo;ll be. Nuthin&rsquo; like &rsquo;mediate action
to relieve man&rsquo;s mind, you know. Let&rsquo;s
take nuther drink and ye can write th&rsquo;
check with steadier hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rayder swallowed another drink while
Amos fumbled about the desk until he
found Rayder&rsquo;s check book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet ye can&rsquo;t spell ten without making a
crook. There now, if you can write thousand
as well you&rsquo;re a peachareno. Bully,
now write Silas Rayder at the bottom.
You&rsquo;re a brother in fact, Rayder, an&rsquo; I love
ye better as any brother. Shay, let&rsquo;s hev
nuther bottle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Amos pocketed the check and quietly
slipped down stairs, to the saloon and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
back with another quart before Rayder
had roused from his drunken stupor. He
poured out another half goblet of whisky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shay, Rayder, de ye know about story
of Guvner of North Carolina sed to Guvner
of South Carolina, to effet an&rsquo; words, it
was long time between drinks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; that was a damn shame Guvner hed
to wait, ought to had you along an&rsquo; famous
epigram ed never been born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later Rayder was stretched
upon the lounge in the little back office, dead
to the world. Amos sat by the window
sobering up until the grey of the morning.
The sleeping man roused, and Amos gave
him another half goblet of whisky followed
by a sip of water. He had drawn the
blinds and left the coal-oil lamp burning
when it grew light, lest the sleeping man
should arouse and discover it was daylight.</p>
<p>When the office boy came, he cautioned
him not to awaken Rayder. He then crossed
over to the bank, called for the face payment
of the check in gold coin. He took
the money to the Wells Fargo Express
company&rsquo;s office and expressed it to his
wife in Saguache.</p>

<p>Rayder was sleeping when he returned.
He placed the check book in its accustomed
place in the desk, destroyed all evidence of
the night&rsquo;s debauch and left a note on the
desk saying: &ldquo;My dear Rayder, I have
been suddenly called home by the illness of
my wife. Come to Saguache as soon as
you can make it convenient. Amos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rayder awoke it was four o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon. His head was in a whirl
and every muscle was twitching. He called
Charley and sent for a doctor. The doctor
saw the trouble at a glance. He called a
hack and accompanied Rayder to his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will never do, Mr. Rayder. You
have drank much whisky in your time and
it has become a poison to your system. Do
not look for me to get you out of this in less
time than four weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XXIV.</h2>
<h3>THE RECKLESS HAND OF FATE.</h3>
</div>
<p>The day was fair when Carson left
Saguache with pretty Annie Amos seated
beside him in the sleigh. Although he had
spent the night in fearful anxiety, walking
the streets, he now felt such a relief over
getting out of town, undiscovered by Mary
Greenwater, that he was bubbling over with
high spirits. In the presence of Annie his
better nature stood outward and he even
surprised himself with his quick sallies of
wit and repartee. Annie was charmed with
his presence, and as the two chatted gaily,
they did not notice the lowering clouds
about the Spanish Peaks, until a strong
wind began to raise and soon one of those
sudden storms so common to the region
was coming in all its fury. In a short
while it became a raging blizzard. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
snow drifted in blinding swirls, so dense
that the horse&rsquo;s head could not be seen.</p>
<p>Carson had experienced the blizzard on
the range and knew the only safe course
was to let the horse have the reins, and
trust to its animal instinct to find a shelter.
He drew the robes securely about Annie
and endeavored to allay her fears, although
conscious of the peril they were in. The
horse was plodding its way through the
snow-drifts and it was evident that the
animal would soon become exhausted. The
blizzard might last all night, or it might
continue for three days. On those trackless
wastes in such a storm death by freezing
was almost certain, unless they reached
a place of shelter. The hours dragged by.
He kept up an incessant talking with
Annie, lest she should fall into the fatal
sleep. The girl was quick to perceive his
tender care, and in full apprehension of
their danger, felt a growing confidence in
the man beside her. She knew that he fully
realized their peril and admired him for
his efforts to conceal his fears from her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>It was growing darker and the horse was
moving with feeble steps. Carson was at
the point of giving vent to his fears, when
the animal stopped. He left the sleigh,
and upon going to the horse&rsquo;s head, found
they were beside a cabin. His heart gave a
great leap of joy and he called exultantly
to Annie.</p>
<p>The cabin was deserted, but, praise
Providence, it was shelter. The door
swung open on its hinges. There was a
fireplace with some half-burned logs in a
heap of ashes. When Annie was securely
inside, he brought in the robes from the
sleigh and next unhitched the horse and
brought the animal inside the cabin. This
made Annie&rsquo;s heart leap with joy; she had
not considered how they would protect the
horse, and this humane act on the part of
Carson gave her the most implicit confidence
in the man. There is nothing to
fear from a man who is so kind to animals,
was her mental comment.</p>
<p>Soon there was a blazing fire on the
hearth. Some poles were found by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
door. These Carson dug from the snow
and brought inside. He had no axe
with which to cut them, and in the emergency,
he laid the ends together in the fire
slantwise from the chimney, and as they
burned away, he shoved the logs forward.
The wind screamed in wildest fury, while
the snow drifted in through the rough clapboard
roof.</p>
<p>Until now no thought had been given to
the lunch which Annie had prepared for
the trip. She brought it out from among
the wraps and when Carson gave the horse
a buttered biscuit as his share of the meal,
she watched the act with a thrill of gladness.
The blazing logs gave warmth and
light, and the man and woman sat and
talked throughout the long watches of the
night, while the snow drifted and the wind
screamed and roared, making the loose
clapboards of the roof creak and groan.</p>
<p>There these two, thrown together by the
reckless hand of fate, told incidents of
their lives and won the love and sympathy
of each other. A new song was born in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Carson&rsquo;s breast. For a moment he
seemed to remember a former life; somewhere
out in the wide, white waste and
hush of infinite space, where they had
known each other and now their souls imprisoned
in forms of clay, they had met by
chance and renewed an old affinity.</p>
<p>As she told him the simple story of her
life, he listened with ever-increasing interest.
An orphan at an early age, she had
since lived in the home of her Uncle Amos.
Everything had gone well until the last
year, when her uncle brought Rayder to
their home and insisted that she should regard
him as a suitor for her hand. Rayder,
old and grey, had dyed his whiskers
and tried to appear boyish. His intentions
were well enough&ndash;&ndash;he would give her all
she would ask that money could purchase&ndash;&ndash;but
she could not love the man and could
never think of becoming his wife. Amos,
her uncle, was a man of avarice and greed.
He insisted that it was a duty she owed
him for his fatherly care in bringing her
up. He dwelt on the advantages it would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
be to him in his old age and that it would
be only right for her to help him in this
way. He had appealed to her generous
nature and sought to make her believe this
sacrifice on her part would be just and
right. Amos&rsquo; wife had taken the same
view of the matter and urged that the wedding
should be at an early date. Annie,
alone in the world, had no one to whom
she could go for counsel. Some of the
coarse women of the mining camp who
came to their home thought her the most
fortunate of girls to have a suitor as rich as
Rayder, and ridiculed the idea of her refusing
to accept the greatest opportunity
of her life. Some of their husbands were
rough, uncouth men, who cared nothing for
the luxuries of a home, spent most of their
money and time drinking and gambling at
the Lone Tree, and they gauged conditions
as they were with themselves. They were
honest-hearted women of the frontier who
believed they were doing the girl a kindness.
It was not through bravery that she
was cool and collected, yesterday, in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
presence of death from the lions, she told
him, but because she had almost made up
her mind that she did not care. Death had
lost its terrors in the contemplation of impending
fate.</p>
<p>He did not tell her of the burden of his
heart. He did not feel that he dared to ask
for sympathy. At that hour he would
have given ten years of his life to undo his
marriage with Mary Greenwater by the ancient
custom of the Swiftest Horse. He
knew the Indian woman and knew that she
intended to kill him and yet he felt helpless,
powerless. He did tell the girl beside
him that he, too, was alone in the world
and hoped to merit the love of a good woman
and that his every act in life should
go to prove his sincerity. And so, amid the
wild scenes of the night, they talked.</p>
<p>At noon the following day, the storm
abated and when the flurries of snow had
ceased they saw the town of Del Norte well
down on the plain.</p>
<p>Annie was received at the home of her
friends with delight and when she told them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
of her recent adventures, they gave expression
to heartfelt joy for Annie&rsquo;s
safety, and called Carson a hero.</p>
<p>Carson did not leave Del Norte for six
weeks. Meanwhile, Annie visited her
friends. When the two were not together
in the cozy parlor at Annie&rsquo;s host&rsquo;s, Carson
kept close in his room at the hotel. He
wanted to delay the meeting with Mary
Greenwater as long as possible. If she was
only a man,&ndash;&ndash;ah, that would be different!
It would then be knife to knife, or bullet
to bullet&ndash;&ndash;he would not shrink. But she
was a woman, an educated Indian woman
upon whom society had some claim, and
she had some claim upon it.</p>
<p>Annie promised to become his wife and
it was arranged that she should return to
her uncle&rsquo;s home, and as soon as he could
arrange his affairs at the mine they would
go to an eastern state. He first intended,
however, to make a clean breast of the
Mary Greenwater affair, and trust his fate
to her love for him.</p>
<p>When he reached the foot of the Sangre
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
de Christo range, through the great depths
of snow, he saw the fearful havoc of the
snow slide and noted the slanting position
of the edgewise cliff. Thinking it was of
but recent occurrence, he hurried to
Saguache and gave the alarm that two of
his companions were buried beneath the
mountain of snow.</p>
<p>In no place in the world does an appeal
for help meet with a quicker response
than among the pioneers of the west. The
news flew over the town like wildfire that
two miners were imprisoned in a snow
slide. A relief party was organized at
once and Carson led them to the base of
the range.</p>
<p>Mary Greenwater saw Carson organizing
the relief, she stood within a few feet
of him unobserved, and could have shot
him, but she knew better than shoot a man
in the act of aiding the distressed. The
crowd would hang her, woman or no woman,
and she knew it. Some other time
than this&ndash;&ndash;she would wait.</p>

<h2>XXV.</h2>
<h3>CORDS OF LOVE ARE STRONG.</h3>
</div>
<p>Hattie Judson sat by the window overlooking
the green wheat fields of the Los
Ossis valley. The bells in the old mission
were calling the humble worshippers of the
valley, just as they had done for more than
one hundred and forty years. She
watched the blue haze of the valley growing
denser in the shadows of the evening.
She heard the low boom of a signal gun roll
up from the sea. It was from the coast
steamer in the open roadstead, the signal
she was listening for in the hope that it
would bring her a letter&ndash;&ndash;the letter for
which she had been waiting for six weeks.</p>
<p>The shadows from the coast hills crept
up the valley, and the stars shone, when
the whistle of the little narrow-gauge engine
announced its arrival from the port.
She put on her wraps and went to the postoffice
and waited a good long hour before
the mail was distributed. There was nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
in her box except the San Francisco paper.
And yet she felt intuitively there
must be some news. She returned to her
home with a vague feeling of dread and lit
the parlor lamp. Mechanically she scanned
the headlines of the paper when her eye
caught the line:</p>
<p class='center'>&ldquo;Imprisoned Miners in Snow-slide;<br />
Relief Party Working Night and Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saguache, Colo.&ndash;&ndash;Word reached here
last night that John Buchan and James
Winslow, miners working a claim on the
Sangre de Christo range, were buried in
their cabin beneath a snow slide. It is believed
the men are alive although there
seems to be small hope of rescuing them
on account of an overhanging cliff which
may topple at any moment, with the melting
snows and crush them out of existence.
Rescue parties are at work night and day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room seemed to whirl and grow dark
as she finished reading. Tears came to
her eyes and she cried aloud. The members
of the family came to find the cause
of her outcry and found her in a flood of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
tears. They read the dispatch and knew
the cause. The paper was two days old
from San Francisco. What could she do?
She must know at once. She went to the
telegraph office and sent a message of inquiry
to the mayor of Saguache. It was
twelve o&rsquo;clock when the message came:
&ldquo;Lines all down in San Luis valley.&rdquo;
There was a telegraph line to San Louis
Obispo, but no coast line railroad nearer
than Paso Robles Hot Springs, sixty
miles inland. It would be three days before
there was another steamer for San Francisco.
She felt that if she waited the suspense
would kill her. She must go to
Saguache.</p>
<p>In the grey of the morning she was
seated beside a driver in a light running
rig behind the swiftest pair of horses in
the town. The northern express was due
at noon and the distance of sixty miles
must be made. The fleet animals climbed
the mountain slopes and crossed the divide
of the Santa Lucia range, and went speeding
through the beautiful Santa Marguerite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
valley with its carpet of green, enlivened
with splashes of yellow from the wild mustard
blossoms. Across the swift flowing
ford of the Salinis river, through deep ravines
and mountain gorges, and over miles
and miles of sun-baked sand and dreary
waste of stunted cactus and sagebrush, the
horses sped.</p>
<p>The scorched winds of the desert caught
up the sands and hurled them hot into their
faces and stung them like tiny sparks.</p>
<p>Dripping with foam the horses were
reined up at the depot platform in just
five hours and fifty minutes from the time
of starting&ndash;&ndash;a record that stands in San
Louis Obispo today as the best ever made,
and that too by a big-hearted western man
who did it only to aid a woman in distress.</p>
<p>The train sped over miles of brown and
parched desert, studded with a growth of
palms that rattled in the sultry wind like
dried sunflower stalks. The scenes were
scarcely noticed by Hattie as she sat in the
coach busied with her own thoughts. The
train was an express but it seemed to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
to creep along. The rumble of the wheels
clanking on the iron rails seemed to say:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be too late, you&rsquo;ll be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Sacramento there was a wait of four
hours for the east bound express, and Hattie
sat in the depot where she could watch
the clock, tick, tock, tick, tock&ndash;&ndash;swinging
the pendulum in these moments of suspense
and waiting. Those monotonous sounds
persistently repeated the single theme, seconds
were born and ushered into eternity
with the slow swing of the pendulum; every
tick brought the time of starting nearer,
but the pendulum swung so slow.</p>
<p>Those four hours watching the clock
were the most tedious of her life. When
the time was drawing nigh and the waiting
passengers were stirring about, the man
in the ticket office came out and wrote
upon the blackboard, &ldquo;East bound Express
two hours late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the slow swinging pendulum sent
a torrent of woe to the unhappy girl, and
when the train rolled into the yards she
felt as though she had lived within sound
of that clock for a year.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></div>
<p>The green valley changed to the red
earth of the foothills, still showing signs of
the gold hunters of 1849. The puffing and
wheezing of the engine told they were
climbing steep grades, and soon they were
in the snows of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
The train entered the forty-two
mile snow shed and when half way through
struck a hand car, derailing the engine.</p>
<p>It was day without, but dark within the
sheds. A kindly woman with her daughter
occupied the berth opposite Hattie. She
noticed the troubled look on the girl&rsquo;s face
and from that time on until they separated
at Cheyenne, did everything she could to
make the journey pleasant. But there was
the ever present suspense and doubt.</p>
<p>It was ten hours before the train was
again under way, but they had lost the
right of way on the road and were compelled
to make frequent stops on the sidings
to allow other trains to pass.</p>
<p>As the train skirted the Great Salt Lake
with its bleak and desolate islands of rock
rising in silhouette against the cold grey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
skies, Hattie compared the scene to the
feeling of utter desolation within her soul.</p>
<p>A storm was raging on the Laramie
plains and when the snow plow, driven by
the tremendous force of an extra engine in
front, stuck fast in the snow, she began
to have some conception of the mighty
force of an avalanche, and the difficulty of
reaching imprisoned men beneath its
weight.</p>
<p>The railroad ended at a little station in
the San Luis valley and then followed
many miles of staging in a crowded coach.
Everywhere the girl met with the most profound
respect and attention from fellow
passengers. She was always given the
best seat in the coach, and otherwise made
as comfortable as circumstances would permit.
Such was the gallantry of these men
of the frontier to the girl who was traveling
alone.</p>
<p>At the last stage station before reaching
Saguache, she heard men talking of the
imprisoned miners in the Sangre de Christo
mountains, but she was unable to learn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
any of the particulars other than that the
relief party was still working. When, at
last, she alighted at the hotel in Saguache
her first question was concerning the imprisoned
men. They will have them out
in a few days if nothing happens was the
assurance given by the landlady. &ldquo;They
are alive, we know, for we can see the
smoke coming out from under the rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men under the snow slide had
been the talk of the town for days. Every
day a new party went to the scene to relieve
those who had worked the day and
night before, tunneling up the steep mountain
side through snow of an unknown
depth.</p>
<p>When Hattie reached the tunnel she
begged to be allowed to go to the end of it
where the men were working. She was assisted
up the mountain side by willing
hands and when she reached the workers
one of them said: &ldquo;The boys are all right
for we can hear their voices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then she gave an exclamation of
joy, and when Buchan said to me in the cabin,
&ldquo;It seems that I hear her voice,&rdquo; he
was right.</p>

<p>Amos staggered out of the fog of powder
smoke and groped his way to the door. He
took the center of the street reeling as he
went, and made his way to his home. The
scenes at the Bucket of Blood were magnified
in his whisky-crazed brain. He raved
in wild delirium, fighting the demons that
gathered around his bedside. The doctor
came and shook his head. &ldquo;He has been
drinking so long that my medicine will not
act,&rdquo; he said. Amos glared wildly from
his bloodshot eyes when a monkey seemed
to leap on the footboard. He held a glass
in his hand. &ldquo;Have a cocktail, Amos,&rdquo; said
the monkey, as he tossed the liquid into the
air and caught it in another glass. Amos&rsquo;
throat was parched and he wanted the cocktail,
but the monkey did not give it to him.
A rhinoceros came creeping through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
wall and looked at him with its leaden eyes.
The monkey tossed the cocktail into the
wide open mouth of the rhinoceros, who
smacked his lips and said to the monkey,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play ante over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; replied the monkey, &ldquo;what
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get his eye, get his eye,&rdquo; exclaimed the
rhinoceros.</p>
<p>The monkey crept forward and plucked
out one of Amos&rsquo; eyes, as he groaned and
yelled. For awhile the rhinoceros was on
one side of the dresser and the monkey on
the other, tossing his eye to and fro between
them. The scene changed. He was
on a white horse, plunging down a steep
rocky road lined with trees on either side;
pythons and rattlesnakes reached out from
among the branches striking their fangs at
his head. There was the form of a dead
woman behind him on the horse. Her cold
arms clung about his neck as little devils
came out from behind the trees and
shouted: &ldquo;You did it; you did it.&rdquo; The
horse was now plunging over a snow-covered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
country. He felt the icy winds chill
his heart. He was trying to shake off the
dead arms that clung to his neck, when
the horse stopped in a wild spot among the
rocks. A grave digger, with the flesh of
face and arms dried to the bone, appeared.
&ldquo;We will bury her here,&rdquo; he said as he
sunk his spade into the earth. As the grave
digger threw up the clods they turned to
little devils, the size of frogs and yelped,
&ldquo;We are the sins of Amos come out of the
grave.&rdquo; The vision passed and another
appeared. Three Sisters of Charity stood
at the footboard of his bed. They were
looking down on him with sorrowful eyes.
One of them lifted her hand and all was a
livid flame. Amos raised his head and
gave one prolonged shriek. A shriek of
death.</p>
<p>When Amos returned to Saguache after
his spree with Rayder his first act was to
purchase a ranch in the San Luis valley
and deed it to his wife. He then went to
his assay office and drew down the blinds
and sat in the shadows like a cunning old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
spider in hiding waiting for the unwary
fly for which he had wove his web. His life
had been that of the iconoclast who creates
nothing to adorn the world&rsquo;s great gallery
of gods. But he was not philosophical
enough to evolve an idea that would disrupt
existing beliefs.</p>
<p>It was some weeks after his arrival
home, when he espied Rayder one morning
coming down the street towards his office.
He cautiously turned the key in his office
and slipped over to the Bucket of Blood
and returned with some beer and two
quart bottles of whisky. When Rayder
returned an hour later he was maudlin
drunk.</p>
<p>Rayder was still pale from the effects
of his recent debauch and when he found
Amos in an intoxicated condition he went
away, not caring to stay and talk with him
on important business matters lest he
should get drawn into another spree.
Meanwhile, Carson had arrived and spread
the news of the imprisoned miners under
the snow slide. Rayder learned that this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
was the mine he had come to purchase
through the connivance of Amos and concluded
to wait and see what time would develop.</p>
<p>Day after day he sought Amos, but the
latter was too drunk to talk with any sense.
He then sought Carson and offered financial
assistance in the rescue work, but the
men spurned the offer. They felt they were
doing a God-given duty and to receive
money for an act of that kind would be debasing
their manhood. Such was it then
and such is now the spirit of the West. He
called at the Amos home, and while he was
received by the matron and failed to see
Annie, he thought he detected an air of distress
in the surroundings, and attributed it
to Amos&rsquo; condition. Feeling that he was
at their home at an inopportune time, he
went away and started out to find Amos
and if possible persuade him to quit drinking.
Not finding him at his office he took
a nearer route and entered the Bucket of
Blood by the back door. He passed two or
three hoboes sitting on beer kegs on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
outside. &ldquo;Say, old timer, can&rsquo;t I dig into
ye for two bits?&rdquo; asked one. The man was
trembly and his lips quivered as he spoke.
Remembering his own recent condition
Rayder handed the fellow a dollar and motioning
to the others, said: &ldquo;Divide up.&rdquo;
The men jumped to their feet with alacrity
and followed the first man to the bar.</p>
<p>Rayder walked to the faro table where
Amos sat with his back to him putting
down twenty dollar gold pieces on the
money. &ldquo;I never squeal,&rdquo; Amos was saying
to another man who was drawing out
the cards from the box. &ldquo;Bet yer life, man
wins my money I never squeal,&rdquo; Amos was
saying to the dealer. &ldquo;Got skads of it anyhow,
and when that&rsquo;s gone I know where to
get a mine worth more an&rsquo; a million.&rdquo;
Rayder stood watching the player tossing
twenty after twenty in gold and tapping a
tiny bell now and then when a waiter came
and took the orders from those seated
around the table watching the game. They
all called for whisky except the dealer, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
took a cigar. It requires a clear head to
deal faro.</p>
<p>Rayder grew tired of watching and sat
down. He was thinking where did Amos
get so much money? He had not attended
to the business of his office since his recovery
and had had no occasion to look into
his check book. After a certain period of
the night with Amos in his back office,
everything was a blank. He remembered
the conversation about Annie and the mine
but had no recollection about signing the
check. To see Amos sitting at that table
losing money like a prince at Monte Carlo,
almost took his breath. He began to feel
certain now as to the fabulous riches of the
mine, for he could conceive of no other way
by which Amos could get possession of so
much money. He had learned of Mrs. Amos
purchasing the ranch and paying for it in
gold, and wondered at the time. Then he
thought that perhaps Amos was trying to
throw him off the purchase of the mine in
order to secure the property himself. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
was a mystery somewhere he could not
fathom.</p>
<p>The board partition against which he sat
was thin, and while he was not playing
eavesdropper, he could not help hearing:
&ldquo;The secret of that mine has been known
to me since I was a child,&rdquo; a woman was
saying, &ldquo;but I never supposed Carson
would locate it when I gave him the papers.&rdquo;
And then she recounted the story
of the hidden Spanish treasure in the
Grand river hills and continued: &ldquo;The
two men they are trying to rescue from
under the snow slide are dead long ago and
the only one left that is interested is Carson.
I will get him out of the way, and you
must file on the claim, I cannot, for I am an
Indian, but you can. Besides, I could never
sing my death song in peace if he lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tonight, then,&rdquo; her companion said.
&ldquo;You had better act before matters go
any farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here was another revelation to Rayder,
he saw coming through one archway an
Indian woman, and through the other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Coyote Jim who slowly walked toward the
faro table. Rayder&rsquo;s first and best impulse
was to see Carson and warn him of impending
danger. His second thought was
that such a course would be bad financial
policy. No, he would let the woman kill
him if she could and he would jump the
claim himself. He was certain now of its
fabulous value and determined to have it
at any price.</p>
<p>And so the old black crow sat and waited
and plotted, while the other old black crow
gambled away his money, and when the
shooting was over, and the coal oil lamps
flickered their sickly flame through the
curling powder smoke, Rayder was raised
from the floor where he had flattened himself
against the baseboard, trembling like a
frightened sheep about to be led to the
slaughter.</p>

<h2>XXVII.</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT OF TRAGEDIES.</h3>
</div>
<p>The Lone Tree saloon and dance hall
was ablaze with lights. Two bar-keepers
in white jackets were setting out the bottles
over the long, polished counter. There
was the clink of glasses, as men stood in
rows drinking the amber-colored liquid.
&ldquo;Have another on me,&rdquo; was frequently
heard along the counter, as someone felt it
was his turn to set up the drinks to the
crowd.</p>
<p>A brawny miner stepped up to the side
of a sheep herder who had been edging in
all evening to get free drinks&ndash;&ndash;and squirted
a mouthful of tobacco juice in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anybody else had done that but you,
Bill, I&rsquo;d be tempted to strike him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your friendship for me spoil
your notions,&rdquo; the miner said with a contemptuous
look.</p>
<p>The sheep herder made no reply, as he
wiped his ear. The fire that burned in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
stomach demanded whiskey, and he would
brook any insult to get it. He had reached
the level of the sodden, and others passed
him by. It was yet early in the night, and
crowds were gathering in the rear of the
large room, about the roulette wheel, the
crap tables and faro layout, back of which
the lookout was seated on a raised platform.
Stacks of coin in gold and silver
were on the tables to tempt the players.
At other tables men were seated playing
cards and smoking. In an adjoining room,
cut with archways, was the dance hall. An
orchestra on a platform played rag-time
music, while painted women in short dresses
to give them a youthful appearance, sat
on benches against the wall, or danced with
swaggering men to the calls of a brawny
bullet-headed floor manager. His bleared
eyes and heavy swollen jaw showed the effects
of a recent debauch ending in a fist
fight.</p>
<p>The women urged their partners to drink
at the end of every dance. While the men
drank whiskey, they gave the bar-keepers a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
knowing look, and a bottle like the others
was set out containing ginger ale which
the women drank as whiskey, and were given
a check, which they afterwards cashed
as their percentage.</p>
<p>While the sign on the windows read The
Lone Tree Saloon and Dance Hall, the
place had earned the sobriquet of the
Bucket of Blood, from the many tragedies
enacted therein. And this place was run
by a woman, Calamity Jane, famous in several
mining camps. One fellow analyzed
her when he said: &ldquo;She is a powerful
good woman, except she hain&rsquo;t got no
moral character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coyote Jim, faro dealer, sauntered in
and took his place at the table. His eyes
were a steel blue, the kind that men inured
to the mining camps of the early west had
learned were dangerous. His face was thin
and white, hair of a black blue, like a
raven&rsquo;s wing, hung half way to his shoulders.
His thin hands handled the pasteboards
in the box with a dexterity that
marked him an expert. Supple in form,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
with quick, cat-like motions, he made one
think of a tiger.</p>
<p>A dark faced woman wearing a Spanish
mantilla was winning at the roulette wheel.
The onlookers crowded about. She was
winning almost every bet. The interest
grew intense, men crowded forward to
catch a glimpse of her whose marvelous
luck surpassed anything in the history of
the Lone Tree. Her stack of chips of white,
red and blue, grew taller at every turn of
the wheel. The face of the gambler at the
wheel grew vexed and then flushed with
anger. The devil appeared to have been
turned loose and he was losing his stakes.
The chips vanished from his box in twenties,
fifties and hundreds, and the group
of onlookers stared in astonishment. As
he counted out his last hundred he said:
&ldquo;If you win this you have broke the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman lost and the gambler began
to have hope, when she won again, and so
the pendulum of chance swung to and fro
over those last hundred chips for an hour,
when the gambler slammed the lid of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
box with the exclamation: &ldquo;You have
busted the game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman cashed in her checks. Over
five thousand dollars was paid to her. She
walked up to the bar and threw down five
hundred dollars on the counter and said to
a bar-tender:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pay for everybody&rsquo;s drinks here tonight.
Take no money from any of them
and when this runs short, call on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word was passed, &ldquo;Free drinks at
the bar,&rdquo; and the crowd surged forward.
A half-tipsy fellow raised his glass above
the heads of others. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s to Mary
Greenwater, Queen of the Cherokee Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rah fer Mary Greenwater,&rdquo; chattered
old Amos, holding his reeling form up by
the bar rail.</p>
<p>The invitation was even too much for
Rayder, strong as had been his resolution
to let the stuff alone. The temptation of
free drinks was too great, he imagined he
needed something and called for gin.</p>
<p>Just then, some one came in and announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
that the two men had been rescued
from under the snow-slide. The games
stopped and the men at the tables ordered
their drinks from the waiters. The dance
in the adjoining room stopped in the middle
of a set, while men and women crowded
about the bar.</p>
<p>Only three in that room did not rejoice
at the news&ndash;&ndash;Mary Greenwater, Coyote
Jim and Rayder. Amos was too drunk to
know whether he ought to be sad or rejoice.
He did neither, but gave another
loud &ldquo;Rah for Mary Greenwater!&rdquo; when
a waiter led him to a seat. When the hubbub
of voices which the announcement of
the rescue had created, had subsided somewhat,
the players resumed their games and
amid the clink of chips and glasses, could
now and then be heard from some gamester,
&ldquo;Hold on there, that&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Greenwater went to the faro table.
&ldquo;Get up, Coyote,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
bust this bank, and you and I have been
together so much that they will think you
have throwed the game. Let some one else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
deal.&rdquo; Another dealer was called and
Mary laid down a hundred on the ace. Men
crowded about as before, when she was at
the roulette wheel. There was a hush for
a moment, when the clear tones of a man
at the door rang out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up, everybody. Don&rsquo;t try to escape,
the doors are guarded!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All was confusion in an instant. Calamity
Jane, eyes ablaze, strode from behind
the curtain in the dance hall. Quick of action,
she fired at the nearest hold-up in
mask. The uproar was furious. The lamps
were shot out by confederates of the hold-ups.
The ball room women screamed with
fright, while jets of fire spit from revolvers
in different parts of the room. Men
were afraid to make an outcry, lest a bullet
would follow at the sound of their voice.
Coyote Jim was crouching like a tiger, beside
the stacks of coin on the table. In his
hand was a long, keen blade. He felt a
stealthy hand near his own and he lunged
the knife. A heavy groan and a few words
in a language which only he understood,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
and the body sank to the floor. The tiger&rsquo;s
blood was now afire and he leaped upon
the faro table, revolver in hand. His form
was outlined in silhouette by a light across
the street, when a spark flashed in the
darkness and he fell headlong to the floor.
There was a heavy roar of voices, as the
men stampeded to the door.</p>
<p>When lights were brought from the outside,
the masked men were gone except one.
He lay dead near the door, with a bullet
from Calamity Jane&rsquo;s revolver in his brain.
Coyote Jim lay dead, and by his side, Mary
Greenwater, with her life&rsquo;s blood still ebbing
from the knife stab.</p>
<p>From this scene of tragedy, Amos made
his escape to end with the horrors of delirium
at home. The Bucket of Blood had
maintained its reputation.</p>
<p>The excitement of the affair spread over
the town, and among the spectators who
crowded in was a haggard man. His eyes
were hollow and deep-set, showing that he
had undergone a severe mental strain for
weeks. He saw them lift the affrighted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
Rayder from his place of safety at the
baseboard, then his eyes rested on the
dead woman at the faro table. He threw
a cloth over her face, and sat staring into
vacancy until the undertaker and assistants
came. Then he took the undertaker
aside and said: &ldquo;See to it that she has a
Christian burial. I will be responsible.&rdquo;
When she was buried the next day, there
was one attendant beside the undertaker
and his assistants, at the grave.</p>
<p>The tragedies of the night marked a new
era in Saguache. The better element arose
in their might and demanded that the
Bucket of Blood be forever closed.</p>

<h2>XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>FROM OUT THE SHADOWY PAST.</h3>
</div>
<p>When Buchan arose in the cabin and
said &ldquo;I thought I heard a voice, her voice,&rdquo;
I was amazed. It did not occur to me that
anyone would attempt our rescue, else why
had they not done it long ere this?</p>
<p>He opened the door and shouted, then
turning to me, exclaimed: &ldquo;They are digging
us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hearts leaped for joy. We shook
hands in expression of delight and Buchan
danced a highland fling around the room.
Two men, snow-covered, entered and hailed
us joyously. Then came a woman, followed
by Carson. She ran to Buchan and
he caught her in his arms. I was deaf and
could not hear what they said or I would
write it word for word, but he kissed her
and she cried, and he wiped away some
tears, and I turned my back and pretended
to be talking to Carson.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>The men gathered up our few belongings
and we hurriedly left the cabin. Sleds were
waiting at the foot of the mountain, and
we were soon speeding toward Saguache.
The air was crisp and the stars shone like
eyes of tender sympathy over the white
plain. We were brought to a stop at the
hotel. Men and women whom we had never
seen came and joyfully shook us by the
hands, and had much to say in congratulation.
The news of Hattie&rsquo;s arrival and her
interest in Buchan had spread over the
camp, and many were the motherly old women
who came to say sympathetic things
and invite her to their homes, so great was
their admiration for her loyalty and sacrifice
for the man she loved.</p>
<p>The next day a mass meeting was called
by the citizens. The Lone Tree saloon and
dance hall had to go. A railroad survey
had been completed through the town, and
public works had been projected by the
newly-elected city council. A new era was
dawning for Saguache. The hall was
crowded, as one citizen after another spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
of the future possibilities of the town, and
a good government that would no longer
tolerate a lawless element. When resolutions
were passed and the assembly was
ready to adjourn, one speaker arose and
said he heartily endorsed everything that
was said and done there that evening, but
there was another matter which should
have attention: One of the men rescued
from under the snow-drift had just married
the girl who had arrived a few days
before from California, and his partner
who led the rescue party had married an
estimable young woman of the town. The
double wedding had occurred at the hotel
an hour before, and he thought it would be
fitting to celebrate the event and the new
era of Saguache with a dance that night, in
which everybody should be asked to participate.
A roar of approval greeted the
speaker. There was no resolution or motion.
None was needed. Men instantly set
to work clearing the hall of chairs, while a
committee was sent to the hotel to announce
to Buchan and Carson that a dance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
had been arranged that night in their
honor.</p>
<p>Men came with their wives and their
sweethearts, dressed just as they were
from their work, and the women as they
were in their homes. Evening clothes
would have been as much out of place in
that ballroom, as the garb of a workman
would be out of place in the ballroom of the
Waldorf-Astoria. The orchestra struck up,
and Buchan and Hattie were given the
place of honor in the dance. Carson and
Annie, being better known, felt that they
should largely play the part of host and
yielded every honor to Buchan and Hattie.
The music was good. Everybody joined in
the spirit of goodfellowship, and the dance
continued until the small hours of the morning.</p>
<p>It was toward the close that Rayder
came upon the floor with a fat widow milliner.
He had taken a few drinks of gin
and was trying to act kittenish when, in the
midst of a cotillion, the widow fell to the
floor in an epileptic fit. They bore the woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
to an adjoining room, where she soon
recovered, but it was such a shock to Rayder&rsquo;s
nerves that he went out and braced
up on a little more gin.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I was at the governor&rsquo;s reception in the
state capitol of Colorado. The rooms and
corridors were brilliantly lighted. Men and
women in rich attire were there to do honor
to the occasion. I was seated behind a decoration
of palms, when a prominent attorney
and a companion took seats near me.</p>
<p>A heavy set man with a woman leaning
on his arm entered the corridor. They
were well, but modestly dressed. There
were grey streaks in their hair, but their
steps were firm and, both were the picture
of good health, evidence of good and
wholesome lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Senator Buchan and lady,&rdquo;
said the attorney to his companion. &ldquo;I
knew those people twenty-five years ago.
I was one of a party to rescue Buchan and
a companion from under a snow slide in
the Sangre de Christo mountains. The girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
had come all the way from California to
help in the rescue. I don&rsquo;t believe she
would have lived two days longer if we had
not got him out. Shows what the right sort
of love will do. It stands the test of time.
There is no divorce business in that.
Buchan had an iron will, too. Somehow he
and his partners had discovered a lost
Spanish mine and did not know its value on
account of some trickery of an assayer.
But Silas Rayder did, so Rayder hounded
the boys to sell and finally when he offered
a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, they
closed the deal. Carson had just married,
too. He took his money and invested it in
a flouring mill. I do not know what became
of the other fellow, but Buchan put his
money in a bank and it failed in less than
three months and he went to running an
engine on the Rocky Mountain railroads.
It was a pretty hard knock, but right there
is where that girl came to the front like a
guardian angel. She told him that perhaps
it was all for the best. Riches do not always
bring happiness. It is adversity that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
brings to the surface our better natures
and fires our ambitions to the nobler and
grander things of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buchan must have had this in mind, for
while he was running his engine he was always
trying to help some poor fellow. He
accepted his lot in life and worked for years
content with the love of that woman and
when people saw he was made of the right
sort of stuff they elected him to the legislature
and his very first act was to put
through a bill making eight hours a legal
day&rsquo;s work. That very act took the yoke of
bondage off more than half a million workers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turned out just as the girl said. He
has served the people three terms and if
he had not worked for their interests they
would never have sent him back the third
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adversity, sir, is oftimes the making of
us. I never thought so when Bob Lee surrendered
and our dreams of imperialism
vanished and left most of us without a dollar.
But I can see now it is all for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
best. As a nation united we welcome all
men regardless of their nationality, and,
in return, they give us the best thoughts the
world can produce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rayder, what became of him?&rdquo; asked
his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Rayder bought the mine he
thought he had millions but he only took
out of it about enough to get even when the
vein gave out between two big slabs of
granite that came together like the thin
end of a wedge. A widow who had fits
sued him about this time for a breach of
promise, and either to get out of that or get
square with some old enemy, he married the
widow Amos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I arose and stood before the attorney and
his companion. &ldquo;I want to shake hands
with you, sir,&rdquo; I said. He arose, and in
extending his hand, said: &ldquo;Your name,
please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the other fellow you rescued from
the cabin,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
